So far, Google+ is for people only.

Google has advised businesses, organizations, and brands &#8212; basically, any entity that isn&#8217;t an individual human being &#8212; to hold off on setting up a Google+ presence.

Eventually though, Google will allow businesses to join. [Over at VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2011/07/22/google-plus-business-profiles/), Jolie O&#8217;Dell quotes a nameless Google spokesperson:

> While Google is mum on exactly what the business profiles will include, the spokesperson did say, “You can expect to see a level of analytics and measurement that you’d typically find in Google products as well as a nuanced approach to how things are shared. It encourages and enhances conversation, it doesn’t just put things in the stream.”

A &#8220;nuanced approach how things are shared&#8221; sounds an awful lot like code for Google+ Ads.

**My bet:** when these Google+ business profiles go live, they&#8217;ll be heavily tied into Google&#8217;s existing advertising infrastructure, and we&#8217;ll see the rollout of something very similar to Facebook&#8217;s ad targeting system:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1082" title="Facebook Ad Sale" src="http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/facebook_ad_sale-300x244.png" alt="" width="300" height="244" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/facebook_ad_sale-300x244.png 300w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/facebook_ad_sale.png 775w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/facebook_ad_sale.png)

Think about it. If you&#8217;ve bought into the whole Google lifestyle, they have your search history, email, breadcrumbs scattered across the web through Analytics&#8230; and now, your social graph. What would _you_ do if your company had all of that?

Here&#8217;s a fun experiment you can do at home: if you&#8217;re on both Google+ and Facebook, go take a look at each sites. Compare and contrast. Did you notice what&#8217;s conspicuously missing from Google+? Yup. Ads.

Right now, my Google+ experience is entirely ad-free. But my gut tells me that&#8217;s going to change pretty soon.
