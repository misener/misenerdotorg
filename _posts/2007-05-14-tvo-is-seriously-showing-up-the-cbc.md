Today, when I checked out the [Democracy](http://www.getdemocracy.com) [Channel Guide](https://channelguide.participatoryculture.org/), I noticed that [_The Agenda_ with Steve Paikin](http://www.tvo.org/cfmx/tvoorg/theagenda) is available as a video podcast. If you don&#8217;t know (or don&#8217;t live in Ontario) _The Agenda_ is TVO&#8217;s daily current affairs program, and it&#8217;s excellent. As a podcast, they offer the entire program as a large downloadable .mp4 file.

You hear that CBC?

TVO offers _the entire program as a download._

Not just a selection of clips, like [The Hour podcast](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=215119383). Or a ridiculous Windows Media stream, like [The National](http://www.cbc.ca/national/latestbroadcast.html). Or a bizarre collection of flash videos on the [official CBC YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/cbc). Or a [partnership with a video site that no one uses](http://stage6.divx.com/CBC). Or like on the radio side of things, a daily &#8220;Best Of&#8221; podcast of a single interview from _The Current_, or _As It Happens_.

Did I mention that TVO offers _the whole show_? Each and every day? All of it?

TVO runs itself on $60 million in government dough. The CBC gets about a billion.

Seriously, this is starting to get embarrassing. Give me one good reason, as someone who contributes to CBC&#8217;s billion dollars a year, why I can&#8217;t subscribe to and download the programming I pay for. It&#8217;s very quickly becoming unacceptable.

In terms of online video, the CBC is no longer falling behind. It has fallen behind.
