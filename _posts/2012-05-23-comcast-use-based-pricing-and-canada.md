In the U.S., Comcast is experimenting with &#8220;use-based pricing&#8221; (which sounds an awful lot like usage-based billing). [The NYT reports](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/comcast-to-test-broadband-pricing-tied-to-use/):

> In the test markets, 300 gigabytes will be the monthly allotment of data for a basic broadband Internet customer. From there, Comcast will try charging a premium for additional data. In one of the tests, customers will be able to buy more data access in what Comcast calls “increments” or “blocks”: for instance, $10 for 50 gigabytes.

One of the article&#8217;s writers, Brian Stelter, was [interviewed on last week&#8217;s _On the Media_](http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/may/18/comcasts-big-change/transcript/). During the interview, he did a little futurecasting:

> I can imagine in the future having to choose both how fast the connection I want, as well as how much data I want to be able to use.

Whoa. Hang on! Internet plans where you pay according to both speed _and_ volume? That sounds awf&#8230; oh, wait a second. That&#8217;s business as usual in Canada.
