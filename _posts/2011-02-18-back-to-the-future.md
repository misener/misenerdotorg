I&#8217;m a sucker for nostalgia, as evidenced by [GRTTWaK](http://grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com). So, you can image my delight when [Jenna](http://twitter.com/zuschlag) sent me a link to [a series of photographs by Irina Werning called BACK TO THE FUTURE](http://irinawerning.com/back-to-the-fut/back-to-the-future/):

> I love old photos. I admit being a nosey photographer. As soon as I step into someone else’s house, I start sniffing for them. Most of us are fascinated by their retro look but to me, it’s imagining how people would feel and look like if they were to reenact them today&#8230; A few months ago, I decided to actually do this. So, with my camera, I started inviting people to go back to their future.

Amazing.
