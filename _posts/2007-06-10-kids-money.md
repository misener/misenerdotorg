It&#8217;s a lovely little film by Lauren Greenfield called [Kids + Money](http://nytimesshorts.feedroom.com/?fr_story=00fa401df1f97c0e0a837bf60c799795f0cb32a6&rf=bm), and it&#8217;s about kids in LA, and what money means to them and their lives.

Well worth the 15 minutes it&#8217;ll take you to watch it.
