Earlier this year, the Coffee Time at Queen and Sherbourne closed its doors because [the owner was arrested](http://torontoist.com/2008/01/illustration_su_22.php) (for allegedly selling drugs out of the store).

It has sat, windows papered over, for months, until recently, they tore down the Coffee Time sign and repainted:

A few days ago, they installed a Popeye&#8217;s Chicken and Seafood sign on the building:

With [Domino&#8217;s opening up down the street](http://misener.org/archives/351), it seems that our block is quickly turning into fast-food central.
