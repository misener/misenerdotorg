A few months ago, with the help of [Tony](http://retiredintoronto.wordpress.com/) and [David](http://www.davidnewland.com/), I led a workshop called &#8220;[A beginnerâ€™s guide to multitrack audio recording](http://misener.org/archives/952).&#8221; The goal was to help singer-songwriters develop the skills necessary to make basic home recordings of their songs.

It went really well. Not to toot my own horn or anything (toot toot!), but here&#8217;s what some people said about the workshop:

> Dan did a great job and gave us enough to enable us to try it on our own. What more could one ask for from a 101? 

> Well organized material; clearly presented, interesting, knowledgeable instructor with great basics logically through to more complex tasks made the information non-threatening.

> The course provided exactly what you claimed it would, but I was surprised that I got even more out of it than I expected. I thought I&#8217;d get enough info to &#8220;know about&#8221; the subject, but I went home feeling confident that I could actually DO it &#8211; and keen to get started experimenting.

> An enormous thumbs up to Dan for presenting a meaningful and enormously worthwhile course on digital recording.

It was so much fun, we thought we&#8217;d do it again. So we&#8217;re putting on the **exact same workshop** for people who missed the first time around.

It takes place on Saturday, September 17, and you can [reserve your spot today](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/191552).
