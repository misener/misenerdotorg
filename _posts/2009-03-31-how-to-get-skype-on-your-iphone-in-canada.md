So here&#8217;s the thing: Skype launched its free iPhone app today [in every single iTunes store except Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/03/30/skype-iphone.html).

So what if you live in Canada and want Skype? No problem. Here&#8217;s what to do:

  1. Sign up for a US iTunes account using [these instructions](http://techwiredau.com/2008/09/grab-a-free-itunes-account-for-any-country/) (no credit card required)
  2. Log out of your Canadian iTunes account, and into your new US iTunes account ([instructions](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1311))
  3. Sync your iPhone
  4. Download and install Skype from the App Store app on the iPhone

That&#8217;s it. Enjoy!
