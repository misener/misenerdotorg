It&#8217;s a few days old now, but Torontoist has a great post on how the new [unlimited data plan from Rogers is actually very limited](http://torontoist.com/2008/02/unlimited_meani.php). [My unlimited data](http://misener.org/archives/310) through Fido should last another two months, but I have no idea what I&#8217;ll do when it expires, now that I&#8217;m addicted to their ubiquitous (though slow-as-molasses) EDGE network.
