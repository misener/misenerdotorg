My intention this week is to write about [Shortmail](http://shortmail.com/), a new email service. But to set the stage, I need to share three examples of Personal Email Policies I Greatly Admire.

**Example 1:** When danah boyd needs a break from digital communication, she goes on an [email sabbatical](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2008/12/11/email_sabbatica.html). Her mail server sends all incoming messages to the trash, and an auto-responder lets all would-be correspondents know that while danah&#8217;s away, their messages will not be received. As danah wrote on her blog, &#8220;You cannot put anything in my queue while I&#8217;m away (however lovingly you intend it) and I come home to a clean INBOX.&#8221;

**Example 2:** I have a friend whose email signature includes the following expectation-setter: &#8220;I respond to short emails at 11:30am and 3:30pm daily. I reserve Mondays to respond to longer emails or in-depth responses &#8211; that way I have the time for a proper answer.&#8221;

**Example 3:** A while back, I heard about [five.sentenc.es](http://five.sentenc.es) (and its siblings [two](http://two.sentenc.es), [three](http://three.sentenc.es), and [four.sentenc.es](http://four.sentenc.es)), &#8220;a personal policy that all email responses regardless of recipient or subject will be five sentences or less.&#8221; The idea here is that you adopt this policy, link to it in your email signature, and don&#8217;t allow exceptions.

Now here&#8217;s the thing: I love all of these ideas. But only on paper.

Practically speaking, I can&#8217;t imagine putting any of these into practice. Maybe it&#8217;s a lack of guts. Maybe it&#8217;s a lack of discipline. As much as I admire these ideas, the closest I&#8217;ve ever come is the standard out-of-office message.

And thus is my initial reaction to Shortmail, a new email service from Baltimore-based [410Labs](http://410labs.com/). I like the idea, but mostly on paper.

Shortmail will be immediately familiar to anyone who&#8217;s used a web-based email service like Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo Mail. But as its name implies, the major difference has to do with length. Shortmail imposes a limit on how long your messages can be: 500 characters. This clearly seems like a page borrowed from the playbooks of pith-obsessed micro-messaging services such as Twitter and Canadian-based StatusNet.

Not only does Shortmail restrict the length of outgoing emails, it imposes the same 500-character limit on incoming messages. If you send me a message that goes over the limit, Shortmail will bounce your email back along with a notification that it&#8217;s too long. You&#8217;re then given an opportunity to edit your message to fit within the limit. This is the digital equivalent of saying, &#8220;Get to the point.&#8221;

I understand why that might be appealing, but I can also see how that might come across as, well, rude. An @shortmail.com address effectively says, &#8220;Play by my email rules, or don&#8217;t play at all.&#8221;

Beyond message length, Shortmail has taken other cues from social networking and micro-messaging services. Its other big difference has to do with sharing. On a one-to-one basis, email has historically been private by default. But Shortmail shakes this up, adding a public option. For example, I can send you an email, mark it as public, and in addition to showing up in your inbox, it&#8217;ll also be published to the web. For example, here&#8217;s a [public email conversation I had with Shortmail creator Dave Troy](http://shortmail.com/public/34333-cbc-shortmail-questions).

Public messages sent through Shortmail are clearly labeled as such. Still, the idea of &#8220;public email&#8221; is a pretty big paradigm shift. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine inadvertently publicly publishing a message intended for a private recipient.

Of course, Shortmail is just one reaction to the decades-old love/hate relationship many of us have with email. Last month, Chris Anderson (of TED conference fame), published the [Email Charter](http://emailcharter.org/), which outlines 10 rules to &#8220;reverse the email spirals&#8221; &#8211; rules that cover principles like writing better subject lines and avoiding unnecessarily open-ended questions. The Email Charter isn&#8217;t a piece of software or a web service. It&#8217;s more of a personal pledge.

Anderson&#8217;s Email Charter (and the aforementioned sentenc.es policies) take a Ghandi-esque &#8220;be the change&#8221; approach to email. Shortmail, in contrast, imposes its vision of better email on all messages sent through its service.

Beyond length-limitation, I wonder about Shortmail and the &#8220;one more thing to check&#8221; factor. I mean, I already have a handful of email accounts. And [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) [accounts](http://twitter.com/sparkcbc/). And a barely used Facebook account. And now, a Google+ account. Do I really need yet another inbox to check on a regular basis? If the goal is to spend less time dealing with email, having a separate account just for short messages seems a bit counter-intuitive to me.

While it&#8217;s interesting to see how the form and function of contemporary social media tools are rubbing off on the decades-old system of email, for me, Shortmail is a bit too much like danah boyd&#8217;s email sabbaticals: something I wish I could pull off, but probably never will.
