<img src="http://poppedculture.ca/images/episodes/ckdu.jpg" align="right" />While home this past summer, I spent some time at my favourite campus/community radio station, [CKDU](http://www.ckdu.ca/). On more than one occasion, I happened upon meetings for the CKDU Pop Culture Collective. I could tell that something exctiting was brewing.

And for the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been enjoying the fruits of the collective&#8217;s labour: [Popped Culture](http://www.poppedculture.ca). Hosted by a cast of CKDU celebs, each half-hour episode is an examination of &#8220;all things pop and culture &#8211; movies and television, music and videogames, books and magazines and everything else that has an impact on popular &#8211; and unpopular &#8211; culture.&#8221; It&#8217;s a blast. So far, I&#8217;ve listened to programs on Jonathan Torrens, J-Pop, Jem and the Holograms, and tonight, the Surveillance Camera Players. I&#8217;ve set my copy of [Audio Hijack](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) to record CKDU&#8217;s [live stream](http://is2.dal.ca/%7Eckdufm/ckdu_hi.pls) each and every week at 5:30 ADT.

&#8220;But Dan,&#8221; you say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t live in Halifax, and I don&#8217;t have any fancy stream-recording software.&#8221; No fear friends! The miraculous Stephen Kelly has set up an MP3 archive of recent CKDU programming. You can stream or download Popped Culture (plus many other quality programs) at <http://ckdu.dal.ca>. For instance, here&#8217;s a link to the [episode I listened to tonight](http://ckdu.dal.ca/20041025.17.37-18.10.mp3).

The CKDU Popped Culture Collective &#8212; is it any wonder Troy Richter called it his &#8220;new favourite posse in the world&#8221;?
