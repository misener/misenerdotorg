This will come as a delight to fans of Jonathan Goldstein&#8217;s [Wiretap](http://www.cbc.ca/wiretap): A guy named Jared Benedict has been posting MP3 archives of the show to [his blog](http://redjar.org/jared/blog/archives/category/radio/wiretap/). I can&#8217;t imagine they&#8217;re authorized, so grab them while they&#8217;re up.

Personally, I record the show off the air with [Audio Hijack Pro](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/) and my [RadioShark](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/index.php).
