Earlier this month, I heard a great piece on NPR&#8217;s podcast of [On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org). It was an [interview with Zachary Pincus-Roth](http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/09/12/08), a freelance journalist who wrote a [piece in the LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-cellfones14-2008sep14,0,5840889.story) all about the effect of cell phones on movie plots:

> While cellphones appear to help storytellers, since they allow anyone to talk to anyone at any time, &#8220;that seeming freedom only makes it all the more difficult,&#8221; says Robert McKee, the screenwriting guru and author of &#8220;Story.&#8221; &#8220;It takes away a possible source of conflict &#8212; the difficulty of communicating, the difficulty of calling for help.&#8221;

Today, via [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5057579/some-movies-would-be-a-lot-shorter-if-the-characters-had-cellphones), a link to this CH video, [If All Movies Had Cell Phones](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1832002):
