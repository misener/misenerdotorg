I work at the CBC&#8217;s Broadcasting Centre in Toronto. Just down the hall from my desk, they built something called an &#8220;Idea Room.&#8221; It&#8217;s a nice, big, bright room with a table, and chairs, and whiteboards. We use it for meetings, where presumably, we come up with ideas. Hence the name.

The walls of the Idea Room are made of glass. Which is nice, but can be distracting.

So today they frosted the glass with decals, [tag cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud)-style. The walls are now covered with lots and lots of words:

Do you see what I see?

**&#8220;mic bomb?&#8221;**

I can only guess this is an unfortunately cropped instance of &#8220;atomic bomb,&#8221; but still.

Is &#8220;mic bomb&#8221; something you want to read _on your way to the radio studios_?
