Well, the second installment of [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://misener.org/read/) is less than a week away. My pal [Tristan](http://tristanhomer.blogspot.com/) was nice enough to create a Facebook event for the night, so if you plan to attend, [RSVP](http://www.facebook.com/p.php?i=717435091&k=e585062930), si vous plait.

Also, through an email from Neil at [Mortified](http://www.getmortified.com/), I learned that our fledgling reading series was mentioned briefly in the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-cringe14apr14,1,885688,full.story?ctrack=4&cset=true). Seriously.

And, if all goes well, I&#8217;ll be interviewed on CBC Radio One&#8217;s new arts/culture/entertainment show [Q](http://www.cbc.ca/q) on Monday, April 30 (the day of the show) about the event.

I&#8217;m really looking forward to Monday, and I have my fingers crossed that people will show up and read.
