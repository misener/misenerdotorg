A weird thing happened in the menâ€™s washroom at work last week. I know, I knowâ€¦ all good stories start like that.

There were two of us in the washroom. The other man finished up before I did, walked over to the sink, lathered up, rinsed, dried his hands, and walked out of the washroom, but he left the water running.

He knew I was there. Did he leave the faucet running for my convenience? Or was he worried I wouldnâ€™t wash my hands? Did he think I needed a friendly reminder? Or was he a germophobe, and didnâ€™t want to touch the dirty taps with his clean hands?

Ultimately, were his actions considerate?

This has never happened to me, and honestly, I donâ€™t know what to think.<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman"" />
