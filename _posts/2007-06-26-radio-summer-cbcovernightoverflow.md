Over on alt.radio.networks.cbc, Dan Say says CBC Radio&#8217;s summer schedule is &#8220;[almost like CBCOvernightOverflow](http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.radio.networks.cbc/msg/38481127b6dd92f4).&#8221; And I have to agree.

Browse through the [lineup](http://cbc.ca/radiosummer), and many of the shows start to look a little, um&#8230; similar.

_Crossing Boundaries_ is

> A 30 minute program featuring **the best documentaries from public broadcasters around the world**, including the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain.

_Global Perspectives_ is

> Global Perspectives is a theme-based program featuring **documentaries from around the world**.

_Spotlight_ is made up of

> The **best programs from public broadcasters worldwide**, presented in their entirety.

_WorldPlay_ is

> Our annual International Festival of Original Radio Drama brings you **original works from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, The USA, Ireland and Britain**.

I honestly wonder what the nation&#8217;s appetite for international programming is, and whether it&#8217;s not currently served by the [Overnight](http://www.cbc.ca/overnight/) service. Or podcasts. Or, uh&#8230; shortwave.
