Earlier this year, I pitched and produced a radio pilot for CBC, based on [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com), the reading series I started a few years ago. The show was a mix of some of my favourite readings from the live events, and some reflection about the role and function of nostalgia in our lives.

Of the things I&#8217;ve done in radio so far, this is one of the things I&#8217;m most proud of.

    The show didn’t get picked up, but the pilot <em>is </em>going to air as part of <strong>The Lab</strong> on CBC Radio One tonight, Friday, August 21, 2009 at 7:30PM (8:00 in Newfoundland), right after <strong>As It Happens</strong>.

    I&#8217;d love to know what you think of the show. Or better yet, I&#8217;d love it if you let CBC Audience Relations know what you think. Call 1-866-306-4636 or <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/contact/">email them using the form on this page</a>. Make sure you include the show name (&#8220;The Lab / Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids”) and the airdate: 7:30PM on August 21, 2009.</div>
