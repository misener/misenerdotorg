If you haven&#8217;t heard by now, you probably don&#8217;t care. But [Gmail now supports IMAP](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/sync-your-inbox-across-devices-with.html), which is awesome. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this for a long time.

The syncing is delicious, with no more messy POPping around.

That said, Google&#8217;s basic setup instructions are a little too basic for use with Apple&#8217;s Mail.app and iPhone. Instead, check out [these instructions](http://5thirtyone.com/archives/862).
