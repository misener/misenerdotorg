I&#8217;ve really been enjoying my time here in Toronto. I&#8217;m halfway through my twenty hours, and have been meeting some very cool people on the line; people I otherwise would never have met: audio post-production television workers, people from corporate communications, graphic designers, national television producers&#8230; the list goes on. Plus, a couple people have asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s your name? Dan? Dan the blogger?&#8221; So that&#8217;s kind of neat.

I&#8217;ve run into several former colleagues from CBL, and several former classmates from Ryerson. Some were employed this summer by CBC, and others dropped by to say hello and do a couple laps with me.

People ask if I&#8217;m back in Toronto for good. &#8220;No,&#8221; I tell them. &#8220;I&#8217;m back just for this week, then I&#8217;ll go to Windsor for a few days. Then, come September first, I&#8217;ll move back to Toronto full-time. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re heard,&#8221; I joke, hoping what I&#8217;m about to say isn&#8217;t true, &#8220;I took a job here as a professional picketer.&#8221;

I hope to be on the line for 11:00 today. There&#8217;s a &#8220;radio meeting&#8221; scheduled for then &#8212; there&#8217;s talk of starting up an &#8220;alternative&#8221; morning show. Which, I&#8217;m delighted, has generated a wonderful dialogue in the [comments section](http://danmisener.blogspot.com/2005/08/is-alternative-programming-good-idea.html#comments) of a recent post.

And in an unrelated note, I&#8217;m really digging [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/index.html) (or the iChat support, anyway). I&#8217;m dmisener [at] gmail [dot] com if you feel like trying it out.
