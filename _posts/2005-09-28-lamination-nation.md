> The more discerning picket will rummage through a pile of signs looking for one not stained with coffee or smeared with lunch. Six weeks of lockout plays hell with cardboard.

Looks like Toronto could learn a thing or two from their friends to the east. When I was in Halifax for the second week of the lockout, I was delighted to find their picket signs laminated. What a concept.

When I was in grade school, teachers would often disappear to a magical far-away building called the &#8220;Resource Centre.&#8221; They&#8217;d leave with a batch of unfinished construction paper art projects, and return with an armload of laminated goodness.

Surely someone in Toronto is married to a sympathetic teacher with keys to a resource centre.
