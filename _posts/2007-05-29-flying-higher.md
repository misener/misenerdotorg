So the [CBC previewed its new fall TV lineup](http://www.insidethecbc.com/watch-the-preview-of-the-new-tv-season-now) today. When I arrived at work this morning, the lobby of the Broadcasting Centre was adorned with large posters not unlike this:

One of the posters features the &#8220;Flying Higher&#8221; slogan with an image of George Stroumboulopoulos floating in mid-air. Another features the cast of Dragon&#8217;s Den, with an airplane flying above them in the sky. &#8220;Flying Higher&#8221; is a nice enough catchphrase, especially with all the talk of &#8220;building on our successes.&#8221;

But the next line just kills me: &#8220;Fall 2007.&#8221;

Now, I understand that they mean the Fall TV season. But when you&#8217;re talking about &#8220;flying higher,&#8221; implying better programming and higher numbers, and connecting that idea visually the concept of _altitude_, &#8220;fall&#8221; can also be read as a verb, as in, &#8220;to drop, come or go down.&#8221;

Interesting choice of words.

And seriously, if you&#8217;re going to include a URL in the promotional material for your new TV season ([www.cbc.ca/newtvseason/](http://www.cbc.ca/newtvseason/)) for Pete&#8217;s sake, put something useful on the website. As I write this, there&#8217;s nothing more there than the image you see above, and a link to a video that doesn&#8217;t work. Come on.
