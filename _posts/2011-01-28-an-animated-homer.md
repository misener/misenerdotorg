[The Compass](http://www.cbncompass.ca/) (&#8220;The Newspaper of Trinity and Conception Bays&#8221;) has a lovely feature article on my pal Tristan Homer called [An animated Homer](http://www.cbncompass.ca/Entertainment/2011-01-25/article-2168833/An-animated-Homer/1):

> In his time with 9 Story Entertainment, Homer has been able to work on several popular shows, including Max and Ruby and Wibbly Pig. The latter was nominated for a Gemini Award in 2010, representing a career highlight for Homer, who was a line producer on the show.
> 
> &#8220;It didn&#8217;t win, but the Polkaroo (from the long-running kids series Polka Dot Door) was at the awards ceremony, and that was pretty fun,&#8221; he says.

Agreed. Decent consolation prize.
