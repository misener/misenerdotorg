I spent this past weekend at the [Third Coast public radio conference](http://www.thirdcoastfestival.org/happenings/conference) in Chicago. In many of the sessions, and hallway conversations, and up-way-too-late-at-a-public-radio-conference-mostly-drunk rants, you could feel a sense of renewed excitement around podcasting, and the wave of independence and entrepreneurship we&#8217;re seeing in this space.

Then, this morning in my inbox, via Seth&#8217;s blog, [a prediction about terrestrial radio](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/11/an-end-of-radio.html):

> Just as newspapers fell off a cliff, radio is about to follow. It&#8217;s going to happen faster than anyone expects. And of course, it will be replaced by a new thing, a long tail of audio that&#8217;s similar (but completely different) from what we were looking for from radio all along.

Podcast networks like [Radiotopia](http://www.radiotopia.fm/), [Infinite Guest](http://www.infiniteguest.org/), [Maximum Fun](http://maximumfun.org/), [Earwolf](http://earwolf.com/), etc. seem well-positioned for what&#8217;s next. Their lineups are full of subject and personality-driven shows. Individually, these shows might not draw broadcast numbers, but in the aggregate, they&#8217;re significant. These podcast networks feature shows that would _never_ find a home over-the-air. Shows that are too niche, or too weird, or don&#8217;t fit a broadcast clock.

Some traditional broadcasters, like WNYC with its [growing slate of nichier, podcast-only programs](http://www.wnyc.org/podcasts/), give me hope that a few dinosaurs might give birth to mammals.

So then, what&#8217;s CBC Radio&#8217;s podcasting strategy? I can&#8217;t pretend to know, but judging from the [current lineup of podcasts](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/), it&#8217;s all about mirroring the existing over-the-air broadcast lineup.

The best podcasts out there embrace the unique properties of the medium. They&#8217;re intimate, and personal. They&#8217;re portable. They&#8217;re not constrained to broadcast lengths. They take advantage of the fact that listeners start from the beginning, every time.

Simply duplicating broadcast programming in podcast form isn&#8217;t going to cut it in Seth&#8217;s &#8220;long tail of audio.&#8221;

Way back in 2008, [Mark Ramsey talked about &#8220;starts&#8221;](http://www.slideshare.net/mramsey1/prpd-2008-mark-ramsey-presentation-presentation) &#8212; small public radio experiments that are all about trying new ideas.

Podcasts are perfect for starts.

Let&#8217;s start something.
