Tomorrow I turn twenty-seven.

And because someone once told me that &#8220;celebration without reflection is hollow and empty,&#8221; here then, in no particular order, are some of the things I&#8217;m most proud that happened in the last year. I:

  * Celebrated a year of marriage (thanks [Jenna](http://twitter.com/zuschlag))
  * Started running (thanks [Beginning Runner&#8217;s Handbook](http://www.amazon.ca/Beginning-Runners-Handbook-13-Week-Walk-Run/dp/1553650875))
  * Started playing the [ukulele](http://misener.org/archives/493) (thanks [Tom](http://tomlucier.com), and thanks [Steve and David](http://torontoukes.com/))
  * Pitched, produced, and hosted my very own [pilot for CBC Radio](http://drop.io/grttwakv3)
  * Started drinking Scotch seriously
  * Helped make another season of [Spark](http://cbc.ca/spark), a show that I think is both important and good
  * Schooled another class of aspiring audio producers at [Ryerson](http://ryerson.ca/rta)
  * Took a weird digital cable channel up on their offer to host a fake talk show
  * Formed a brand new rock and roll band with my friends Tristan, Mike, and Isaac

Here&#8217;s to becoming old!
