Via [Music Thing](http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2005/10/there-is-god-and-his-name-is-sony-pcm.html) comes the announcement of Sony&#8217;s new professional flash recorder &#8212; the [PCM-D1](http://aes.harmony-central.com/119AES/Content/Sony/PR/PCM-D1.html):

> It records 24/96 wav files on 4gb internal, or memory sticks. It has analog VU meters. It runs off four AA batteries. It&#8217;s made by Sony. Out of titanium.

I wonder what it&#8217;d take to get a review unit out of them before it ships in December.
