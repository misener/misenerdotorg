I&#8217;ll admit that up until yesterday, I was unaware of the CBC Television program _[The Big Decision](http://www.cbc.ca/thebigdecision/)_.

(Aside: I predict that within five years, every single CBC Television program will be based around _Dragons&#8217; Den_ personalities.)

Anyway, I didn&#8217;t know about _The Big Decision_, but after following some tweet or another, I found myself on the show&#8217;s website, and decided to check it out. Here&#8217;s what happened when I hit the play button:



In case you missed it, the video thumbnail was replaced by a completely blank rectangle, while a robotic voice soaked in reverb said, &#8220;This content is currently unavailable.&#8221;

I suspect this is because I&#8217;m in France, and the content has been geoblocked. My suspicions were confirmed after I used [Sidestep](http://chetansurpur.com/projects/sidestep/) to connect to a Canadian proxy server and was able to view the video without any problems.

Now, my issue isn&#8217;t with the geoblocking itself. [I completely understand](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2009/10/spark-89-october-25-27-2009/) the business reasons why certain types of online content are restricted in this way.

My problem is how _The Big Decision_&#8216;s geoblocking is implemented.

If I&#8217;m being geoblocked, _at least have the decency to tell me I&#8217;m being geoblocked_. Do this:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1343" title="Helpful geoblocking message" src="http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-17-at-4.37.08-PM.png" alt="" width="663" height="360" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-17-at-4.37.08-PM.png 663w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-17-at-4.37.08-PM-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" />

I&#8217;m no UI genius, but it&#8217;s not hard to recognize that a completely blank screen and reverb-y robot voice that says, &#8220;This content is currently unavailable,&#8221; is less than ideal feedback. There&#8217;s just not enough information to be useful.

Why, dear robot voice, is the content unavailable? Do I not have the right plug-in installed? Are there gremlins in the CBC&#8217;s online video system? Or am I outside of the geofence?

If I&#8217;m being geoblocked, tell me. At least then I&#8217;ll know when to fire up Sidestep.
