The other day, [my Dad](http://twitter.com/dmisener) suggested that I might like the [Stack Overflow podcast](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/podcasts/), so I subscribed.

At around 46 minutes into episode [79](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/podcast-79/), [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) mentions [brochureware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware)-style web design:

> You know the kind of site I&#8217;m talking about? It&#8217;s just like you can imagine it printed on glossy paper and being given to you by hand. And it just doesn&#8217;t look like a web page.

But it&#8217;s the next line that&#8217;s the kicker:

> **It&#8217;s on the web. But it&#8217;s not of the web**.

And right there, Joel put his finger on exactly what bugs me about so much of what CBC does online, particularly with radio show websites. Yes, it&#8217;s on the web. But it&#8217;s not _of the web_.
