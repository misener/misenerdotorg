I do, I really do. [iSquint](http://www.isquint.org) is the program that I use on my Macintosh to turn huge DV files into iPod video compatible files for the [Jim Dupree](http://www.foursevens.com/jimdupree) podcast. Now, there are a lot of ways to do this, and I&#8217;ve tried several, but by far, iSquint is the easiest and fastest. The program does exactly what it promises, handles any kind of video file I can throw at it, and best of all, the dialogs and release notes have a sense of humour.
  
What more could you ask for?
