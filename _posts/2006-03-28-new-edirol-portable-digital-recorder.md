One of my favourite gadget blogs, [Engadget](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/roland-r09-portable-recorder-163487.php), points to the release of a [new portable digital recorder from Edirol](http://www.biosmagazine.co.uk/article.php?id=3111) &#8212; the R-09 ([product page](http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.aspx?ObjectId=757&ParentId=114)). The specs look pretty nice:

  * 24-bit/48kHz (or 44.1kHz) uncompressed recording
  * Up to 320kbps MP3 playback and recording
  * Records to SD card (64MB card included)
  * High-grade stereo condenser microphone built in
  * Mic and Line audio inputs; USB I/O
  * Easy operation, user-friendly graphic display
  * Ultra portable, half the size of the R-1
  * Long battery life

I considered Edirol&#8217;s R-1 for a while, but eventually settled on an M-Audio Microtrack 24/96. I always throught the R-1 was kind of clunky, so the R-09 should be nice. I especially like the built-in mics, and that it runs on AA batteries.
