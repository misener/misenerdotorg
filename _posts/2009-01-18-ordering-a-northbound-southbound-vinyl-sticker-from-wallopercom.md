In late December, [Jenna](http://twitter.com/zuschlag) and I finally received our [Northbound Southbound](http://walloper.com/northbound-southbound) vinyl wall decal from [walloper.com](http://walloper.com/). It&#8217;s awesome. We love it.

But though the decal itself is terrific, and looks great in our apartment, the shipping and customer service from Walloper was **abysmal**. We ordered the decal on November 20, and it didn&#8217;t arrive until more than a month later, on December 23rd. In the meantime, Jenna sent several emails, the first of which was ignored or lost (Derek at Walloper cited a &#8220;spot of trouble with our email provider&#8221;), and they misquoted delivery timelines twice. I understand that walloper is a small company with an overnight success on their hands, and I realize that it&#8217;s run by a small handful of people. But still, I can&#8217;t help but feel like they could have handled us a little better.

Still&#8230; the product is pretty cool:
