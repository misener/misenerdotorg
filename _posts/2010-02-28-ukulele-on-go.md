This past Saturday, along with Jimmy the Uke and Steve McNie, I was once again on [GO](http://www.cbc.ca/go/) to pimp the ukulele. It was a lot of fun, as always. Here&#8217;s an mp3 of the segment: [audio:http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-goukulele_20100227945.mp3] 

There&#8217;s a [photo gallery at the GO website](http://www.cbc.ca/go/pg-270210.html), and courtesy of [Tom](http://www.youtube.com/user/pixscene), YouTube clips of Jimmy the Uke playing “When You&#8217;re Smilin&#8217;”:



and Jimmy, Steve McNie, and me playing, “We Will Rock Uke”:
