[Once upon a time](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/20/controversy-over-thi.html), you could download old episodes of [This American Life](http://www.thislife.org) by grabbing MP3 file locations from the M3U files posted on their website. The MP3 files lived here:

> http://audio.wbez.org/tal/**SHOWNUMBER**.mp3

But that stopped working.

These days, though you can still listen to TAL archives, downloading them has become a bit trickier because the shows are hidden behind a flash player. But, that flash player is still pointing to an actual downloadable MP3, and [Christopher Soghoian](http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2007/01/new-location-for-this-american-life.html) has figured out where they live:

> http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/jomamashouse/ismymamashouse/**SHOWNUMBER**.mp3

Come on&#8230; that directory structure is pretty hilarious.

Replace **SHOWNUMBER** with the episode number ([338](http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/jomamashouse/ismymamashouse/338.mp3) for example), and you&#8217;re good to go.

If you download and enjoy This American Life, you really should [donate](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/donate).
