Shhhh&#8230;

[cbcpodcasts.wordpress.com](http://cbcpodcasts.wordpress.com) says it&#8217;s &#8220;for the CBC shows that fall through the podcast cracks.&#8221;

It liberates Jowi Taylor&#8217;s excellent series [The Nerve](http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/features/theNerve/) from Windows Media hell.

It lets you easily download Terry O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s fantastic [Age of Persuasion](http://www.cbc.ca/ageofpersuasion/) (which is not impossible via cbc.ca if you know how to click &#8220;View Source,&#8221; but it&#8217;s needlessly difficult).

Plus, they have a couple of other CBC radio shows that didn&#8217;t get podcasts.

Grab &#8217;em now before they&#8217;re gone.
