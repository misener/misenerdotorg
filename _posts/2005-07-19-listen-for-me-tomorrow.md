If you tune into your local CBC morning show tomorrow (Wednesday, July 20), you might hear me talking about the new LCD displays at Tim Hortons. I did the piece in my spare time last week, and it&#8217;s being syndicated across the network tomorrow. From today&#8217;s Content Factory outlook:

> TIM HORTONS SCREENS
  
> Tim Hortons is adding a new item to its menu. Or rather, the new item _is_ the menu. Video displays are being installed in Tim Hortons menu boards across the country. The CBC&#8217;s Dan Misener visited his local Tim&#8217;s to find out what customers are saying about the new screens.
