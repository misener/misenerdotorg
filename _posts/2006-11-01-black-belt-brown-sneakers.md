In my comments this morning, a link from <a title="Link outside of this blog" class="blines3" target="_blank" href="http://www.dunnit.com/">Dunnit</a>, makers of my new favourite sneakers. Seems theyâ€™re <a title="Link outside of this blog" class="blines3" target="_blank" href="http://dunnitshoes.blogspot.com/2006/10/free-dunnit-shoes-u-joking-me.html">giving away free shoes</a> to people who can provide a compelling enough reason. So hereâ€™s mine:

Far too often, I wear a <a title="Link outside of this blog" class="blines3" target="_blank" href="http://www.rampway.org/article.php?id=245">black belt with brown sneakers</a>. Apparently this is a no-no:

> Belts are accessories. Belts shouldnâ€™t be worn to hold your pants up, because you should get pants that fit in the first place. Because belts are accessories, you should wear the same color belt as your shoes. And if you buy brown shoes, and you donâ€™t have a brown belt, get one. The same goes for black.

Dunnit, a pair of black sneakers would really improve my situation. Help me out?
