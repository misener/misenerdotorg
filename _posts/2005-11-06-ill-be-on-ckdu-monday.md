I have an item on tomorrow&#8217;s [Popped Culture](http://www.poppedculture.ca) on CKDU.

Last month, I attended the fourth annual [World Rock Paper Scissors Championship](http://www.rpschamps.com) here in Toronto. I was feeling a bit dejected, because everyone I pitched the idea to didn&#8217;t want it (it&#8217;d been covered to death in past years). But I&#8217;d signed up for media credentials, and I thought it sounded fun, so I went anyway. I ended up with a bunch of tape I didn&#8217;t know what to do with. I sat on it for a couple weeks.

Then last week, a serendipitous email from Melissa Buote arrived, telling me the theme of this week&#8217;s show was &#8220;Games.&#8221; Suddenly, my story had a home.

The moral: even if you don&#8217;t think anything&#8217;ll come of it, if your gut says go, go. And bring your tape recorder.

So if you&#8217;re in Halifax, and within broadcast range, have a listen. The show airs at 5:30 PM AST at 97.5 FM. Or, tune in live online at [ckdu.ca](http://www.ckdu.ca) or subscribe to the [podcast](http://podcast.ckdu.ca/).
