Once, as [thebeastieboys](http://www.youtube.com/user/thebeastieboys), [Tristan](http://twitter.com/tristanwayne) and I covered a terrible/awesome mid-1990s top 40 song.

And thrice now, as [TheBARSandTONE](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheBARSandTONE), we&#8217;ve done the same. Most recently, we tried making what Robin Sloan calls a [production-as-performance](http://snarkmarket.com/2009/3683) video:



The song is &#8220;[Name](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=656).&#8221; There are 11 separate video tracks, each recorded individually. We made the whole thing in [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm), which is pretty hilarious, because ScreenFlow is screencasting software, and not particularly suited to this sort of thing.

So, within the genre of terrible/great mid-1990s pop songs, I ask you&#8230; **what song should we try next**?

**Update:** [looks like we covered the wrong Goo Goo Dolls song](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100913/08130610987.shtml).
