I noticed something strange earlier this week. [Peter&#8217;s Cajun Creole Pizza](http://www.peterscajunpizza.ca/), our favourite pizza place,Â was dark before midnight. Then, Tina left a comment at this blog suggesting that Pete&#8217;s has been &#8220;[shut down by the landlord](http://misener.org/archives/502/comment-page-1#comment-14658).&#8221;

Tonight, upon closer inspection, I confirmed that Pete&#8217;s (and Peter&#8217;s Corner) are indeed closed, and there are notes on both doors from the landlord.

Not good.

Where will I get my panzerotti fix?
