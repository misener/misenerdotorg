After weeks of intense posting, some lockout bloggers [are](http://www.yougeek.ca/2005/10/one-last-cbc-lockout-post.html) [winding](http://cbcunplugged.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/10/4/1278209.html) [things](http://cbcstrike.blogspot.com/2005/10/happy-trails-it-seems-bit-surreal-now.html) [up](http://cbcworkerbee.blogspot.com/2005/10/farewell.html). I applaud their efforts, and thank them for their work and dedication.

A group called the [CMG Lockout Archive Project](mailto:cmg.archive.project@gmail.com) is working to establish a collection of lockout blogs, photos, etc.

But for me, the blogging continues.

I started this blog about a year ago, long before the lockout. Originally, the point was to document my post-graduatation life. Basically, &#8220;follow Dan around as he tries to find a career in public radio.&#8221; If you look back through some pre-lockout posts, you&#8217;ll find information and links on what I was listening to, what I was working on, and gadgets I coveted.

As the lockout wraps up, the focus of my blog will shift back to its roots. If you came here looking for lockout content, I hope you&#8217;ll check in once in a while and find something interesting.
