This week, [Jenna](http://twitter.com/zuschlag) signed a contract to spend the next two years working for [The Dominion Institute](http://www.dominion.ca/) heading up [The Memory Project](http://www.thememoryproject.com).

She&#8217;ll put together a team that will travel across Canada to collect oral histories from Canadian WWII veterans, then put them online.

It&#8217;s good, important work, and I&#8217;m really proud of her.
