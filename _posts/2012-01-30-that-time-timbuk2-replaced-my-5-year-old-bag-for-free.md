I love it when I experience great customer service. It seems to happen so infrequently that I feel compelled to share whenever it does. Every once in a while, you deal with people who stand behind their company or product so much that you can&#8217;t _not_ tell people about it. For example, when the Australian Boot Company [replaced my 2-year old boots in 2009](http://misener.org/archives/591). Or when [they did it again](http://misener.org/archives/789) a year later.

This time, it&#8217;s a story about [Timbuk2](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/home). They make bags.

About five years ago, I bought a black/black/black Timbuk2 laptop messenger bag from Europe Bound in Toronto. I love it. It&#8217;s perfect. It holds all my stuff, and is great for daily commuting or a weekend trip. It&#8217;s travelled with me almost everywhere I&#8217;ve been for the past half decade.

But last summer, I noticed that my bag&#8217;s original velcro flap fasteners just weren&#8217;t as, well, velcro-y as they used to be:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1135" title="DSC_0472" src="http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0472-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://home.misener.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0472-300x199.jpg 300w, http://home.misener.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0472-1024x680.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0472.jpg)

Not surprising for something that gets ripped apart several times daily. Still, a bit of a nuisance. So I emailed customerservice@timbuk2.com, and asked: &#8220;Can you suggest the best way to repair this?&#8221; The reply arrived later the same day:

> If you don’t mind us sewing through the flap, we should be able to replace it for you.  You can fill out a warranty claim here:  <http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/retail/warrantyreturn.htm>

A kind offer, but I wasn&#8217;t keen on them sewing right through the bag to fix it. So I asked, &#8220;Is there any way to replace the velcro w/o sewing through the flap?&#8221; Again, a very speedy reply:

> Looks like we can try to repair it, or worst case scenario, just replace the bag. Go ahead and follow the instructions here, and we’ll get you all squared away! <http://www.timbuk2.com/wordpress_cms/customer-service/the-timbuk2-quality-guarantee/>

So I filled out their warranty form, got an RMA number, and then, **promptly did nothing for a year**. Yes, that&#8217;s right. I got busy, or lazy, or perhaps just plain forgot, but I never sent my bag for them to diagnose and/or try to fix. I just kept on using the bag with the non-velcro-y velcro. It wasn&#8217;t ideal, of course, but it got my stuff from point A to point B.

12 months passed, and then, a few weeks ago, for whatever reason, I decided to email Timbuk2 again. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s been a year,&#8221; I wrote, &#8220;But does your offer still stand?&#8221; Their reply:

> You can go ahead and still send the bag in. Just make sure to write that RMA number on the outside of the package and we will either issue you a store credit or fix the bag.

Keep in mind this is **more than a year** after I filled out the original warranty claim, and **five years** since I bought the bag. And I didn&#8217;t even buy it from them! I bought it from a third-party retailer. So I headed to Canada Post to mail my messenger bag off to San Francisco.

Well, as it turns out, shipping a messenger bag (even an empty one) can be pretty darned expensive. So, I emailed Timbuk2 one more time to let them know that I appreciated their offer, but that the cost to ship my bag to them was prohibitive.

A few days later, their reply (from Heather):

> We apologize for the long wait.   I sent over another email with a credit code in it to use on our website. You can use this to purchase a new bag. _We just ask that you donate your current bag to someone in need._

Boy oh boy, that&#8217;s above and beyond. And that last line &#8212; that&#8217;s classy.

Want to guess who I&#8217;ll buy my next bag from?
