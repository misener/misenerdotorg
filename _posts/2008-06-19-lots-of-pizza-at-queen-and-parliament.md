For some reason, our corner is going crazy for pizza.

Today, I stopped into the soon-to-open [Magic Oven](http://www.magicoven.com/) at 360 Queen St. East, and talked to the owner, Tony about [my little WiFi project](http://public.meraki.com/network/Corktown). He said they plan to open for tomorrow night, Friday the 20th.

A bit farther west, there seems to be a Domino&#8217;s going in:

Makes me wonder what effect all this will do to my favourite pizza spot on the corner, Pete&#8217;s:
