I love riding my bicycle. I ride it to work, I ride it to school, I ride it to pick up groceries. I use and enjoy my bicycle enough to warrant owning a nice one.

But the problem is, I live in a city (and a neighbourhood) where nice bicycles get stolen. Quickly. Thus, for the past four or five years, I&#8217;ve simply resigned myself to the fact that I need to own crappy bikes that aren&#8217;t worth stealing. These bikes, of course, are not much fun to ride.

Whenever I&#8217;ve talked to bike shop guys about this problem, they&#8217;ve said, &#8220;Well, you should buy a nice bike. Just bring it inside.&#8221; I know that&#8217;s what I _should_ do, but it&#8217;s something I would never _actually_ do. I can&#8217;t imagine lugging a bike up the flights of stairs to our apartment, let along finding a place to put it.

So then, last weekend, when Jenna and I were walking along Bloor Street, and we ducked into [Curbside Cycle](http://www.curbside.on.ca) (&#8220;Just to see&#8221;), I again explained my conundrum to the salesperson, Aaron. He countered by showing me the [Brompton Folding Bicycle](http://www.brompton.co.uk/). Gorgeous, and handmade in London, they fold down to a package that weighs just about 25 pounds.

Perfect! This is a bike that I could actually imagine carrying up some stairs, or bringing into my office.

I took one for a test drive on Saturday, and loved it. It feels a lot like a &#8220;real&#8221; bicycle, despite the smaller wheels. A bit low to the ground, obviously, but otherwise, a totally normal, comfortably smooth ride. I tried folding and unfolding it a few times, and I&#8217;m not quite at the 30-second fold yet, but I&#8217;ve been assured that with practice, I will.

So yesterday, I bit the bullet and placed my order: a 3-speed M-type in Cornflower Blue (similar to the one above, without the leather Brooks saddle).

Because Bromptons are all custom, the turnaround is about 3 weeks. It&#8217;s going to be a long wait.
