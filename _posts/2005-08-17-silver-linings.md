Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed finding and reading blogs by other CBC employees. It&#8217;s nice to come across sites like [Mind the Gap](http://cdnmoz.blogspot.com/) &#8212; they serve as a reminder that there are other young public broadcasters who feel the same way I do.

Working at a station full of veterans, it&#8217;s sometimes easy to forget there are other people in the same boat: young, interested in a career, and worried.
