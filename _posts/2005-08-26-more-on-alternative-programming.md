Via my friend Hilary, from [Antonia Zerbisias](http://thestar.blogs.com/azerb/2005/08/dialling_for_do.html)&#8216;s excellent blog:

> And, for those Toronto area listeners who are missing their Andy Barrie, Metro Morning is doing a dry run on Monday on CIUT 89.5 FM, and is set to go live Monday to Friday 6:30-8 starting Labour Day.
> 
> It&#8217;s great that these dedicated CBCers want to continue practising their craft and serving the public interest, even as management is disregarding it. But aren&#8217;t they concerned that, by doing all this work for nothing (or even less if they have to pay for programming expenses out-of-pocket), they&#8217;re showing that CBC can get by with less taxpayer funding?
