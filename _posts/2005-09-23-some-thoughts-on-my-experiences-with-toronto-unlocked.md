This morning, _Toronto Unlocked_ wrapped up its three-week run on [CIUT](http://www.ciut.fm).

I had some initial reservations about the program. At the start, no one had convinced me that it was a good idea. I wasn&#8217;t sure that we (the CMG) weren&#8217;t shooting ourselves in the foot. Though I didn&#8217;t buy the &#8220;we&#8217;re scabbing ourselves&#8221; argument, I questioned the wisdom of feeding an appetite we were trying to create with our silence.

During _Toronto Unlocked_&#8216;s first week on the air, I discussed it with a lot of people on the picket line. I solicited opinions from people I respect and admire &#8212; journalists, hosts, and producers. I told them I was thinking about signing up for the show. Some were supportive. Others were dead set against it.

Then I decided I was making too big a freaking deal about it. I got over myself, and realized that the show was going to continue whether I was involved or not, and my participation (or lack thereof) wouldn&#8217;t make a huge difference. So I signed up. And for the second and third weeks, I chase produced for the Wednesday morning shows.

It felt good. It felt good to make phone calls. It felt good to get stressed out about guests falling through. It felt good to book people. It felt good to pre-interview. It felt good to be back in a campus/community radio environment. It felt good to work on a story, then wake up the next morning and hear it on the radio.

Ultimately, my reasons for participating were selfish. I miss working, and _Toronto Unlocked_ let me work. I wanted to reconnect with my CBC colleagues. I wanted to meet new people. I wanted people to know I&#8217;m back in Toronto and keen to work.

And if I had to do it over again, I would.
