A week after [launching, then pulling](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/07/google-latitude-iphone-app/) its [Latitude](http://www.google.com/latitude) client from the app store, Google has [officially released an iOS mobile location tracking/sharing app](http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20025433-264.html). Personally, I&#8217;m quite excited about this.

Previously, I&#8217;d been using a clunky combination of a [friendless Foursquare account](https://twitter.com/misener/status/9371089025114113) + [Mayor Maker](http://mayormaker.com/) as a &#8220;tell my wife where I am&#8221; system.
