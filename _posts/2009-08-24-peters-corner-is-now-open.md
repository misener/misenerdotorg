Peter&#8217;s Corner (&#8220;Profile of Excellence&#8221;) is now officially open for business on the Northeast corner of Queen and Parliament. Hope to try it out soon, if I can wean myself off [Pete&#8217;s Cajun](http://www.peterscajunpizza.ca/). I&#8217;ve not yet stepped inside, but judging by the menu boards, it _has_ to be better than the previous tenant, Mr. Tasty.
