[Alanna](http://alannacavanagh.blogspot.com/2010/03/joanna-schnellers-advice-for-oscars.html) quotes [Johanna Schneller&#8217;s advice to the producers of the Academy Awards](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/message-to-the-academy-twitter-has-led-you-astray/article1498873/):

> Stop courting the audience that doesnâ€™t care about you, and stop alienating the audience that does. 

If you ask me, a whole lot of CBC programs would be smart to take the same advice.
