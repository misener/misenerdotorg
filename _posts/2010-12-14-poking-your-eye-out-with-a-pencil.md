From WYNC&#8217;s [On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/12/10/04), Bob Garfield on online advertising, [behavioural targeting](http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/12/10/04), and the danger of surveillance:

> The threat, while looming, is like poking your eye out with a pencil. Enabling conditions do not guarantee the worst outcome.

Amen.
