<img src="http://www.fabulousfoods.com/features/tunakahuna/tom.jpg" title="Tom eats tuna" alt="Tom eats tuna" align="right" height="234" width="145" />Congrats to my pal Tom who made a [guest-blogging appearance](http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/guest_blog_070421.html) on the Detoit Pistons&#8217; site.

> Having season tickets is just about being a more informed fan that stays on top of things and follows the importance of a particular game or matchup and the health of the players. On Wednesday I won my fantasy basketball league, beating 12 guys who probably know more about basketball than me. I feel like I know every detail of every game with these guys because Iâ€™m at The Palace so often. You just feel like youâ€™re more of a part of whatâ€™s going on there. So thatâ€™s the advantage for me, more than having tickets all the time, just having the constant knowledge that a fly-by-night, bandwagon fan might not have.

Nicely done, buddy. Watch out for the shellfish, though.
