From [Al&#8217;s Morning Meeting](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=2) (a daily read of mine) comes this video called [How Al Tompkins Produces His Video Blogs](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=2&aid=141773).

The secret? A [Flip Video](http://www.theflip.com/) camera.



The crew at [Spark](http://cbc.ca/spark) has been wanting one of these little cameras for a while now, but we haven&#8217;t got our hands on one yet. You see, as far as I can tell, they don&#8217;t ship to Canada. However, Al had a good idea: buy one on eBay. A [quick search](http://search.ebay.ca/flip-video_Cameras-Photo_W0QQcatrefZC12QQfromZR40QQsacatZ625) yields several sellers willing to ship to Canada.

Wait, scratch that. I just checked, and it seems TigerDirect.ca has them [in stock](http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3680671&CatId=3360).
