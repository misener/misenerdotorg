[Cyrus](http://cyrusfarivar.com) has a [piece up at Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/05/boxfish-aims-to-modernize-real-time-tv-search.ars) about [Boxfish](http://beta.boxfish.com/), a search engine for closed captions scraped from broadcast television:

> BoxfishÂ captures all closed-captioning information, indexes it, then makes that data searchable in a Twitter-style interface. All in real-time.

If this technique sounds familiar, perhaps it&#8217;s because [Google did something very similar way back in 2005](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4205267.stm):

> The service, Google Video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes. It only searches US channel content currently.
> 
> Results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken.
