A few weeks ago, I spent some time in Winnipeg with team [DNTO](http://cbc.ca/dnto). While I was there, we watched the world premiere of three short animations based on some of Sook-Yin Lee&#8217;s stories. [This one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjH2M7evJiA&feature=channel_page), directed by Jim Goodall, is my favourite of the three, and I&#8217;m not just saying that because they used my voice (very briefly):



You can check out all three animations on [DNTO&#8217;s YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/CBCdnto). The CBC &#8220;Entertainment&#8221; &#8220;Portal&#8221; has copies too, but lacks permalinks, so I won&#8217;t bother linking there.
