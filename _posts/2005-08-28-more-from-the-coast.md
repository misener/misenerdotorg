Here&#8217;s another excellent [report from Stephanie Domet](http://thecoast.ca/issues/250805/wextras.html) about the lockout.

I&#8217;ll soon join Stephanie and my other [Haligonian collagues](http://cbclockout.org/) on the line. That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m headed to Halifax this Monday, and will stay for about a week.
