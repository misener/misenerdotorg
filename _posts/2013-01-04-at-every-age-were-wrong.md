It&#8217;s no secret that [I&#8217;m a fan of laughing at our former selves](http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/).

So then, I rather enjoyed [John Tierney&#8217;s NYT piece about new research into people&#8217;s self-perceptions](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/study-in-science-shows-end-of-history-illusion.html?_r=0):

> “Middle-aged people — like me — often look back on our teenage selves with some mixture of amusement and chagrin,” said one of the authors, Daniel T. Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard. “What we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. At every age we think we’re having the last laugh, and at every age we’re wrong.”

Though this part hit a little too close to home:

> Dr. McAdams was reminded of a conversation with his 4-year-old daughter during the craze for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the 1980s. When he told her they might not be her favorite thing one day, she refused to acknowledge the possibility. But later, in her 20s, she confessed to him that some part of her 4-year-old mind had realized he might be right.

Something to keep in mind for the next GRTTWaK.
