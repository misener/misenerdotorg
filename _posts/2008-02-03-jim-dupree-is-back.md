Ever since the final episode of [Jim Dupree: Enthusiast](http://www.collectiveproductions.com/jimdupree) about a year and a half ago, people have asked, &#8220;Are you ever going to make more episodes?&#8221;

The answer for a long time was, &#8220;No.&#8221;

But as of yesterday, that answer changed. Starting on Groundhog Day 2008 (yesterday), we started to release season four of the podcast series, on a schedule that can only be described as &#8220;[Fibonacci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).&#8221; Here&#8217;s the release schedule:

> **Season 4, Episode 1:** February 2, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 2:** February 3, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 3:** February 5, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 4:** February 8, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 5:** February 13, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 6:** February 21, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 7:** March 5, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 8:** March 26, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 9:** April 29, 2008
> 
> **Season 4, Episode 10:** June 23, 2008

That&#8217;s right. The time between episodes gets exponentially longer.
