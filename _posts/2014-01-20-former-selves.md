As anyone who&#8217;s been to [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com) probably knows, I&#8217;m fascinated by the relationships we have with our former selves. Most often, when a person gets up on stage to read juvenilia at GRTTWaK, there&#8217;s a distance. A distance between who they were, and who they are now. At a really basic level, I think that&#8217;s the tension that makes a GRTTWaK reading funny, or uncomfortable, or bittersweet.

And it&#8217;s a big part of what I love about Chino Otsuka&#8217;s photo series [Imagine Finding Me](http://chino.co.uk/gallery/IFM/ifm_intro.html). In it, Otsuka takes old family snapshots, and pastes in present-day versions of herself:

I first saw Otsuka&#8217;s work in Glenn Fleishman&#8217;s [Glenn&#8217;s Gumbo](http://tinyletter.com/GlennF) newsletter.

Speaking of Glenn&#8217;s newsletter and nostalgia, here&#8217;s a lovely excerpt from [earlier this month](http://tinyletter.com/GlennF/letters/i-know-karate):

> My friend [Leah](https://twitter.com/ohheygreat) used the word _saudade_ from the Portuguese recently. Wikipedia has [a surprisingly lyrical definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade):
> 
> > It describes a deep emotional state of nostalgic or deeply melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing will never return.

I don&#8217;t know Portuguese, but I wonder if it&#8217;s possible to feel saudade for a younger version of yourself. Because deep down, I suspect there&#8217;s a fair amount of that blowing around at GRTTWaK, too.
