In Tuesday&#8217;s Globe, there was a [good overview](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051101.wxcbcradio01/BNStory/Entertainment/) of the coming changes to CBC&#8217;s afternoon lineup. The changes are slated to take effect this Monday.

I&#8217;m particularly interested to hear how local afternoon shows in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver will deal with an extra half hour to fill every day.

Local afternoon shows are notoriously hard up for resources. They don&#8217;t get the same numbers as morning shows, and consequently, aren&#8217;t as well staffed. Most shows I&#8217;ve heard seem (and sound) stretched thin as it is. Lots of music and syndicated content. Here in Toronto, [Here and Now](http://www.cbc.ca/hereandnow/) will be longer by 20 percent, but I highly doubt they were allocated 20 percent more resources.

I&#8217;ll be listening carefully next week.
