This past Friday, after work, I went to the TD Canada Trust to pick up some cash for the weekend. When I looked down, I noticed an unopened bottle of Heinz Tomato Ketchup on the counter in front of the teller.

Then I looked down the length of the counter. There were bottles of ketchup in front of every teller.

So I bit.

&#8220;What&#8217;s this bottle of ketchup for?&#8221; I asked.

&#8220;So you&#8217;ll ketchup on your RRSP,&#8221; she replied. It was perhaps the best and worst thing I&#8217;d heard all week.
