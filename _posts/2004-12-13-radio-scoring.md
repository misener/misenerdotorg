[Glass](http://transom.org/guests/review/200406.review.glass1.html) on music:

> Generally the kind of music we use is more emotionally neutral. Its goal is more to keep a sense of motion, to keep things moving. And to underline the turns in feelings. I&#8217;m not against manipulating feelings. The whole job is about manipulating feelings. If you don&#8217;t get in front of that and embrace it with a big bear hug, you&#8217;re not doing your job as a radio producer. You just don&#8217;t want to be all corny about it. 

I like music. When I&#8217;m looking for a piece of music to play under a radio piece, I often look to movie soundtracks.

As do many others. I hear a lot of Mark Mothersbaugh&#8217;s work from Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums on [This American Life](http://thislife.org/pages/scoring.html) and (not surprisingly) [Wiretap](http://www.cbc.ca/wiretap/). Also, I often recognize music from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Amelie underneath CBC radio promos. Soundtrack music is so often instrumental, and because it&#8217;s usually written to play under voices, is perfect underneath radio stories.

So I was delighted today to [read](http://p210.ezboard.com/fyankeeracers33503frm16.showMessage?topicID=218.topic) about the release of [The Life Aquatic](http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=2&article_id=1906) OST. The reviews look good so far.

Other instrumental music I like for scoring:

  * Paul Haslinger&#8217;s tracks from [The Girl Next Door](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:79ktk6kxtkrf) 
      * [Lost in Translation](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:69kmu3laanok) 
          * [Desperado](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:2x7tk6jxqkrg) 
              * Beastie Boys&#8217; [In Sound from Way Out!](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:tmduak6khm3k) </ul>
