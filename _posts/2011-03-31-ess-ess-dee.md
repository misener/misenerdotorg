The first time I heard the virtues of solid-state drives extolled was on [One Thing Well](http://onethingwell.org/post/977670277/go-ssd). Then, Gruber and Dan Benjamin kept mentioning them on [The Talk Show](http://thetalkshow.net/). My pal [Thomas](http://www.44wide.com/) started swearing by SSDs. And when [Khoi Vinh blogged](http://www.subtraction.com/2011/03/17/life-in-a-solid-state) about his SSD experience, I finally broke down and ordered a [Mercury Extreme Pro SSD](http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/internal_storage/Mercury_Extreme_SSD_Sandforce/Solid_State_Pro) from OWC.

Holy smokes.

I&#8217;m now a believer. Our family&#8217;s [mid-2007 MacBook](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp18) got a serious kick in the pants. As Khoi said, &#8220;It really is like getting a brand new computer.&#8221; For a couple hundred bucks, an SSD breathed new life into our four-year old laptop. Now it seems just as snappy (if not moreso) than the flashy new MacBook Airs we play with at the mall.

If you&#8217;re considering swapping out your HDD for an SSD, do it now.
