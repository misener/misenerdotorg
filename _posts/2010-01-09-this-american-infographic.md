A very, very cool project: [This American Infographic](http://tai.ejfox.com/).

> My new years resolution is to make an infographic on every This American Life ever made. The idea is to expand and add context to the stories and information contained in the shows. Basically, anything I am curious about while listening to the pieces.

That&#8217;s a tall order, given that there are almost 15 years&#8217; worth of episodes. Can&#8217;t wait to see more of these.
