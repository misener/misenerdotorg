So the other day, on the walk back from the grocery store, I listened to this [past week&#8217;s _On The Media_](http://www.onthemedia.org/2013/may/10/). It began with a question:

> is the Golden Age of content sustainable, or just a _supernova_, a dying star burning exceptionally bright?



Then, thirty-one minutes and forty-five seconds later, a small bit of instrumental music underneath an extro and sponsor read. The tune sounded familiar, but I couldn&#8217;t quite place where I&#8217;d heard it before.

Then it clicked.

&#8220;Champagne Supernova&#8221; by Oasis.

A tiny detail, easy to miss. But boy oh boy, that&#8217;s craftsmanship.
