I don&#8217;t often get my CBC budget cut analysis from the sports section, but maybe I should.

From [Bruce Dowbiggin&#8217;s take on the recent cuts](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/cherrys-salary-makes-him-a-big-fat-target-for-cbc-cuts/article2393660/):

> CBCâ€™s core business, its relevance to the public, would probably be in the following order: 1. News and current affairs; 2. Radio; 3. Sports; 4. Light entertainment. The problem with the current CBC is that its executive structure has the order reversed.

Though I&#8217;d quibble with Bruce&#8217;s list &#8212; there are news and current affairs programs _on_ radio, for instance &#8212; this rings true to me.
