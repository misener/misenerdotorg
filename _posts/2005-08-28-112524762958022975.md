From [Peter](http://ruk.ca/article/3112):

> [T]his lockout is going to result in a sort of &#8220;dark ages&#8221; in terms of the digital fossil record. Our ancestors (our even ourselves, in a year) will go the CBC website to search for stories about things that are happening now and will find nothing. Worse, when our friends at the CBC are allowed to work again, they will have no audio or video record of news that&#8217;s happening now. Which means that, in essence, nothing that is happening now is actually happening at all.
