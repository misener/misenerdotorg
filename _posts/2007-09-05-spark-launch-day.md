Spark, our brand-spanking-new radio show launches. On-air, the first broadcast happens at 11:30 local time. And online, the [podcast is already available](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/blog/2007/09/show_notes_september_5_8_2007.html) as an MP3.

And, through the magic of Creative Commons licensed music, the podcast version and the broadcast version are the <span style="font-style: italic">exact same</span>.

That alone has me excited. Please, have a listen and let us know what you think.
