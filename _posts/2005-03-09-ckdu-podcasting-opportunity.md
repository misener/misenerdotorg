When I was home a few weeks ago, [Laura](http://justfriends.ca/peek/) told me about a new vegan baking show on CKDU &#8212; [Let&#8217;s Get Baked with Mat and Dave](http://www.letsgetbaked.ckdu.ca/). I&#8217;d not heard it before, but was delighted to find a [halifaxlocals post](http://media.locals.ca/localsconf/viewtopic.php?t=20669) about the show, reminding me that past programming is archived at [ckdu.dal.ca](http://ckdu.dal.ca).

Might I suggest that great community radio + mp3 archives = a pretty good [podcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting) opportunity? Even though the broadcast start and end times are variable, I&#8217;m sure the talented Mr. Dunlap could whip up a nice handmade XML feed.

I&#8217;d subscribe.
