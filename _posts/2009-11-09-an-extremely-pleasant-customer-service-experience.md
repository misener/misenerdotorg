Sometime in 2007, I bought a pair of [Blundstones](http://www.blundstone.ca/) from the [Australian Boot Company](http://www.australianboot.com/). They were great boots, and they became very very comfortable over time. This morning, I noticed that the sole of the left boot was coming apart:

I sent a quick email to the Queen Street location, with a link to the photo, asking for suggestions. About ten minutes later, I received a response from an actual human being named Andria. She told me to bring the boots in to have them assessed for warranty.

I brought my boots to the shop after work this evening, and they replaced them with a brand new pair, under warranty, with no receipt (Andria found a record of my purchase in their database).

Colour me impressed.
