It&#8217;s been on my &#8220;to watch&#8221; list for quite a while, and today I finally got around to watching [Jad Abumrad&#8217;s presentation at MaxFunCon 2010](https://vimeo.com/17316537).

In it, Jad uses many examples from [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) (and borrows heavily from [Walter Murch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Murch)) to create a model that explains the relationship between words, music, various types of sound effects, and their relative levels of abstraction. Needless to say, if you&#8217;re interested in radio (or sound at all, for that matter), find an hour, and watch this in its entirety:



As I watched, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice a common thread between Jad&#8217;s model of sound, and Scott McCloud&#8217;s [Big Triangle](http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/triangle/index.html),  which aims to &#8220;put all of comics’ visual vocabulary (pictures, words, specialized symbols, etc.) into some kind of easily understood map of possibilities.&#8221;

It&#8217;d been a while since I&#8217;d last read _[Understanding Comics](http://www.scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html)_, and in digging around for an image of the Big Triangle, I came across Scott McCloud&#8217;s terrific TED talk, in which he explains his entire model:



The whole thing is good, but if you&#8217;re looking for to compare and contrast Jad&#8217;s sonic model with Scott&#8217;s visual one, skip ahead to 7:47.
