This past weekend I moved most of my earthly possessions to Jenna&#8217;s. As of August 1, we will officially be cohabitating, and no longer spending enormous amounts of money on two separate apartments. The move was remarkably easy thanks to Rae and her car. There are still a few things at my old place, but all of the big stuff is gone.

Also, I&#8217;m happy to report that I have a new-ish job. Starting August 13, I&#8217;ll be working on the new Nora Young show [Spark](http://sparkshow.blogspot.com). It&#8217;s a great concept, a great team, and I can&#8217;t wait to get started, but I&#8217;m really going to miss all the people I work with now.

As well, I&#8217;ve been offered a job at my alma mater, Ryerson. I&#8217;ll be teaching audio production part-time in the School of Radio and Television Arts. I have one section of BDC101, and it&#8217;ll take up my Tuesday evenings starting in the fall.

Wow.

After writing that, I realized what an enormous amount of my life changed in the past two weeks.
