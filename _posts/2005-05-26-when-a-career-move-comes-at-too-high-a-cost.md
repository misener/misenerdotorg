About two weeks ago now, I moved from Toronto, Ontario to Windsor, Ontario, for a job at the CBC. Before I decided to take the contract, I asked friends, family, and profs for their opinions. I didn&#8217;t know much about Windsor, and didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d fit in. I still don&#8217;t, really.

A friend passed along Adelle Waldman&#8217;s excellent article called &#8220;[When a Career Move Comes at Too High a Cost](http://www.careerjournal.com/myc/survive/20050421-waldman.html).&#8221; It&#8217;s about Adelle&#8217;s first job out of journalism school, how she moved from New York to Cleveland, and how she blew it. She reflects on what she did wrong, and explains what she could have done differently.

It&#8217;s well worth the read.
