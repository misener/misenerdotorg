[Amber MacArthur](http://www.ambermac.typepad.com/index.html) interviewed Tristan and me today about [Jim Dupree: Enthusiast](http://www.foursevens.com/jimdupree/) for a G4techTV show called [Torrent](http://www.g4techtv.ca/torrent). Basically, Torrent takes video podcasts, and puts them on television.

It was nice to be asked to participate, but strange. Our podcast is so unbelievably silly, it&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone wanting to ask serious questions about it.

A friendly fellow named Sean took a [pile of photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/globalhermit/tags/torrent/), and posted them to his Flickr account.
