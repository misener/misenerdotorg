This weekend, I listened to a pretty great episode of This American Life: [Mapping](http://thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=110). In the first act, Ira Glass interviews <span class="text"><span id="ctl00_Content_Body_lblDescription">Denis Wood, a cartographer, who creates &#8220;maps that are more like novels, trying to describe everyday life.&#8221;</span></span>

Partway through the interview, Ira says of Wood&#8217;s work:

> It&#8217;s interesting. Its taking the premise of a map, which is that it&#8217;s a way to describe the world, and then pointing it at things that we usually don&#8217;t think of as being mappable.

This immediately reminded me of [an interview with Ira in the New York Times Magazine](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04WWLNQ4.t.html), in which he describes how the storytelling in TAL is different from traditional journalism:

> We’re taking the tools of journalism and applying them to people whom you wouldn’t normally apply them to — people who aren’t famous, people who aren’t powerful, people just like you and me.

It seems that Ira really likes this idea of reframing context.
