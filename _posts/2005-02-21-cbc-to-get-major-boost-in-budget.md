Opened the paper this morning to some potentially good news: [CBC to get major boost in budget](http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2005/02/21/937387-sun.html):

> The CBC will get a multimillion-dollar boost when the federal budget is tabled Wednesday, CP has learned. The extra cash will be enough to restore local programs, notably regional newscasts, a senior government source said on condition of anonymity.

Here&#8217;s hoping that somewhere in those first 34 million dollars there&#8217;s some money to give me some regional backfill work this summer.
