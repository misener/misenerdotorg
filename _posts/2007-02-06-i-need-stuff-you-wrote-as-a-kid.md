Do you still have anything you wrote as a kid? A poem? A book report? A diary?

I want you to read it out loud. In front of people.

I think most of us have a collection of stuff from our younger days sitting in a box somewhere. We cart it around from apartment to apartment, strangely attached. We have no practical use for this stuff, but at the same time, we don&#8217;t have the heart to throw it away.

So let&#8217;s put an end to that, shall we?

On **Monday, February 19, 2007** at 8:00 PM, upstairs at [The Victory Cafe](http://www.victorycafe.ca/), I&#8217;m hosting an evening of drinks, laughs, and adults reading funny, sad, and/or embarrassing things they wrote as children.

Here are the rules:

  1. You have to be the one who wrote it, as a kid
  2. You have to be the one who reads it, as an adult
  3. It has to be short (<5 minutes-ish)

It will be free. And it should be fun. But it will only be fun if people actually attend, and bring things they wrote as kids.

So clean out your closet. Dust off that shoebox of grade school love letters. Call up your mom in Newfoundland and get her to send you that old book report. Then show up, with cash for a drink from the bar downstairs.

**Backstory:** Over the holidays, Jenna and I were visiting her parents in Kingsville. She came across an old diary, and we spent a good chunk of the afternoon reading it aloud to each other. On their own, the entries were really sweet and funny, but they were even sweeter and funnier out loud. So I made it a New Year&#8217;s Resolution to start a reading series. This evening of reading is the first step towards that.

**P.S.** I also need a clever name for this evening. Got one for me?
