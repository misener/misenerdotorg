Bill St. Arnaud, on [the need for a National Public Internet](http://billstarnaud.blogspot.com/2010/12/need-for-national-public-intenet-npi.html):

> it is well within the realm of possibility to deploy both a wired and wireless National Public Internet (NPI)– that is committed to the principles of an Open Internet. I am not advocating that we replace the telcos and cableco and their “Internet-like” service. But much like PBS and NPR provides an alternate voice to the mainstream broadcasters, NPI could ensure that there remains an independent and open Internet with all the benefits that entails in terms of innovation, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.

I&#8217;ve often wondered whether the CBC could become an ISP. In theory, I think it could, and it&#8217;d be a great way to help fulfill [the CBC&#8217;s mandate](http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/about/mandate.shtml). In practice, though, probably not so much.
