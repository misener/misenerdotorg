This afternoon, I had the pleasure of doing a short talk on &#8220;social media&#8221; for many of the hosts and producers of local and regional CBC Radio afternoon shows. I&#8217;ve talked about social media and radio before, mostly in the context of Spark.

But here&#8217;s the thing: local and regional afternoon shows are completely different from Spark. Spark is a one-hour, pre-taped, weekly show. By comparison, local and regional afternoon shows are several hours long, and live, each and every single day of the week. I&#8217;ve worked on these shows, and they can be gruelling. So, the focus of my talk was how shows could prioritize their online efforts, given limited time and resources.

Here&#8217;s the theory: some online tools work particularly well in a realtime context, and some online tools work particularly well in an on-demand, time-shifty, random access context. The trick is choosing your tools wisely.

Realtime tools embrace what Nick Carr calls &#8220;[Nowness](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2010/03/nowness.php).&#8221; What&#8217;s going on right this minute. Twitter is a realtime tool. Facebook is, in many modes, a realtime tool. Foursquare, Gowalla, and their ilk are realtime tools. On the other hand, podcasts are on-demand, time-shifty tools. A radio show website, updated once a day, is an on-demand, timy-shifty tool.

So, let&#8217;s map these tools onto radio.

Radio is &#8220;the immediate medium.&#8221; It&#8217;s fast. Live radio is full of &#8220;nowness.&#8221; Something big can happen, and you talk about it on the air right now. But live radio items can also have a long-ish shelf life. A feature interview with the mayor will still be interesting in a week, whereas your traffic and weather reports won&#8217;t.

So here&#8217;s the point I tried to make this afternoon: if, like most CBC radio afternoon shows, you have limited time and resources, be smart about which online tools you use. Use realtime tools for realtime information. Use time-shifty tools for time-shifty information.

I think realtime tools and live radio go really, really well together, and there are some terrific examples out there. [CBC&#8217;s Here and Now](http://twitter.com/#!/cbchereandnow), for example, or [The Dave Ramsey Show](http://twitter.com/#!/ramseyshow). Tools like Twitter and Facebook are great for discussion, feedback, contests, questions, and overall, providing an additional layer on top of a live radio show.

Live radio show audiences (if that&#8217;s what we call them anymore) are passionate. They are intelligent. They want to help. They want to connect. If you ask me, as a public broadcaster, we have a responsibility to connect with them in as many ways as we can muster.
