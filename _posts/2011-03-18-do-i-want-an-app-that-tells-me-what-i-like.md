This week&#8217;s CBC tech column is all about the double-edged sword of online personalization. [There&#8217;s a copy up at cbc.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/03/14/f-vp-misener.html), and one below for posterity.

===

Last week, a Vancouver-based app-maker called [Zite](http://www.zite.com/) launched a new iPad application of the same name that it bills as &#8220;a personalized iPad magazine that gets smarter as you use it.&#8221;

As a member of the so-called Generation Y, I am, of course, a narcissistic egomaniac with an affinity for anything that promises to shape itself in my image. So, of course, I downloaded it.

Here&#8217;s the idea: Zite brings together stories from across the web — blog posts, magazine articles, stories from news websites — and filters them by your particular interests, creating an up-to-the minute personalized reading list just for you.

The underlying technology was developed at the University of British Columbia&#8217;s Laboratory for Computational Intelligence.

Zite&#8217;s fundamental innovation is that it tracks how it&#8217;s being read.

After narrowing down the subject areas, it shows you a number of stories it thinks you might like, then it tracks how you interact with them.

&#8220;We have an underlying philosophy that &#8216;you are what you read,&#8217; explains CEO Ali Davar.

&#8220;When you&#8217;re on Zite, and we see you bypassing articles that we&#8217;ve recommended to you, that tells us as much as when you select an article. So, when you do that continuously, through time, we learn something about you.&#8221;

## Staying on track

Zite also pays attention to the form and content of what you&#8217;re reading. Is it a long article? A short article? Who wrote it? Does it come from a particular political viewpoint?

By tracking your reading habits, Zite tries to give you more of what you&#8217;re interested in, and less of what you&#8217;re not.

This tactic will sound familiar if you&#8217;ve ever bought something from Amazon, used a TiVo, or watched Netflix.

All of these services track people&#8217;s behaviour, then use that information to give them more of what they like.

When I tried the Zite app, I really did have the sense that it was learning about me.

And while I recognize that these recommendation services can be useful, part of me can&#8217;t help but worry. Specifically, I&#8217;m concerned that online personalization will perpetuate my bad or lazy habits.

For instance, I spend a lot of time reading gadget blogs. Arguably, too much time. Over the past two weeks, there&#8217;s no question that I&#8217;ve read more reviews of the iPad 2 than necessary.

I know others with similar vices: Hollywood gossip blogs or obsessive sports coverage. My question is: Do I really need a tool that will help me find yet another iPad 2 review? Or would I be better off reading something new and unfamiliar?

## Comfort versus challenge

For another perspective on this, I called Ethan Zuckerman, a researcher at the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard University.

As he put it, &#8220;personalization is absolutely a double-edged sword. You can imagine it being a force to challenge you, and push you towards things you might not otherwise have read.

&#8220;You can also imagine personalization cocooning you in a world of familiar, unthreatening, unchallenging, but copacetic news.&#8221;

Zuckerman frames this tension as &#8220;comfort versus challenge.&#8221;

And it is the first part that worries me. That by giving me more of what they think I want, these personalization tools might actually narrow my worldview. They might cocoon me in the comfortable to keep me coming back.

When I asked Zite&#8217;s Davar about this, he told me his company&#8217;s technology is focused on what he calls discovery.

&#8220;It&#8217;s not simply about getting more of the same. It&#8217;s actually quite the opposite. The challenge is to give you the things that you wouldn&#8217;t typically find if you went out and looked for yourself.&#8221;

From a technical point of view, this is apparently a difficult feat. There are two very different answers to the question why didn&#8217;t you read that.

One is, I didn&#8217;t read it because I know I won&#8217;t like it. Another is, I didn&#8217;t read it because I didn&#8217;t know it existed.

Training computers to tell the difference is hard, but Zite believes they&#8217;ve found a way, using a secret algorithm sauce.

Zuckerman, on the other hand, told me that &#8220;anytime someone is providing algorithmically-organized information, there are some politics behind it. And you really owe it to yourself to think about what those politics are.&#8221;

The personalized recommendations that come from Netflix and Amazon are generated by proprietary algorithms. We don&#8217;t know exactly how they work, but we do know their objectives: to sell more stuff, and keep subscribers watching.

Zite&#8217;s algorithm is also proprietary and Davar says it took &#8220;a lot of money and a lot of time to develop.&#8221;

Zite&#8217;s service is currently ad-free, but Davar told me the company plans to add advertising and a subscription model to generate revenue.

It seems we&#8217;re headed towards a world of increasing personalization. As such, it&#8217;s important to think critically about personalization technologies.

When faced with an algorithmically-generated recommendation, we need to ask questions like why is this being recommended to me. Is it making me comfortable, or is it challenging me? And who&#8217;s getting paid?

For me, it&#8217;s about recognizing your own personal blind spots, and not necessarily trusting a computer algorithm to help fill them.

Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have to go read another iPad 2 review.
