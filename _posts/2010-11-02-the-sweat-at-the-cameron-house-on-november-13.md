**Update: Apparently, we&#8217;re playing a rock show immediately after a play. So the show will start around 10 (not 9, like the poster says).**

Yes, it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m still in the rock and roll band called The Sweat. We&#8217;ve averaging about 1 live performance per calendar year, and 2010 is no exception. We&#8217;re playing Toronto&#8217;s historic [Cameron House](http://www.thecameron.com/) on November 13.

There&#8217;s a [Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=138140256238749), and even a poster. If you&#8217;re in Toronto, I&#8217;d love to see you at the show.
