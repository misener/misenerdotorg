Hands down, [Jim Dupree: Photography Enthusiast](http://www.collectiveproductions.com/jimdupree/2008/02/13/episode-35-jim-dupree-photography-enthusiast/) (released yesterday) is the best episode released this season, and in my opinion, closest to &#8220;vintage Dupree.&#8221; If you&#8217;ve been holding out on watching the exciting fourth season, wait no longer:
