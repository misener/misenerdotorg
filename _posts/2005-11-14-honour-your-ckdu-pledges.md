Via the [halifaxlocals](http://media.locals.ca/localsconf/viewtopic.php?t=42484) forum comes news that [CKDU&#8217;s annual funding drive came up short](http://www.dalgazette.ca/html/module/displaystory/story_id/689/format/html/displaystory.html). That could mean for some tough times ahead.

> The spoils of its funding drive already account for roughly one-third of its budget. And the station drained its savings this year to buy a new transmitter, antennae and other equipment to increase its output power from 33 to 3,200 watts. Staff wages were increased from $9.65 to $12 per hour to be more in step with national standards and the stationsâ€™ student levy is down due to a drop in enrolment.

CKDU is home to some really great programming, like like Popped Culture, Let&#8217;s Get Baked, Smart Patrol, and The Rose Parade.

So honour your pledges. Please.
