For a few months now, I&#8217;ve been getting email addressed to my **dmisener@gmail.com** account from a guy named Keith. The emails haven&#8217;t been for me, but rather for someone named Diane Misener. Apparently we have very similar email addresses.

For months, I simply deleted Keith&#8217;s email. I know I shouldn&#8217;t have, but I deleted the first one because it was one of those joke email forwards that people send around, and I figured it was just a mistake. Then another one arrived, and another one, and I deleted those too. Eventually it got to the point where I couldn&#8217;t contact Keith to explain the mistake, because doing so would mean admitting I&#8217;d silently deleted all of his email to Diane.

Eventually, I started to feel pretty bad about all of this, so I phoned up Keith and Diane. The whole story is on [this week&#8217;s episode of Spark](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/blog/2008/02/show_notes_february_13_2008.html).
