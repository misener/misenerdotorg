[<img width="180" height="240" border="0" align="right" alt="Parka in closet" src="http://static.flickr.com/68/211381262_ee055c151d_m.jpg" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmisener/211381262/ "Photo Sharing")&#8230; begins with a single parka.

Yes, it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve started moving into my new place. As of September 1, I&#8217;ll no longer be living with [Phil](http://philipsullivan.blogspot.com/) and [Tristan](http://podcastofmydiscontent.blogspot.com/). I got myself a tiny little bachelor apartment at Victoria and Shuter. It&#8217;s close to Jenna, close to work, and close to the Queen subway station.

Even though I won&#8217;t move the bulk of my stuff until this weekend, I started today. I stuffed my parka into a plastic shopping bag, dropped it into the milk crate on the back of my bicycle, and drove it down the street. Luckily, I&#8217;m [not moving far](http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=m5b2m4+to+m5b2r3&ie=UTF8&om=1).

It looks pretty lonely all by itself in my closet, but soon enough, there&#8217;ll be more than enough crap crammed in beside it to keep it company.
