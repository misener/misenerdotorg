Paul Adams, writing about [the future of the CBC](http://www.ipolitics.ca/2014/04/15/time-for-cbc-to-make-a-big-gamble/) for iPolitics:

> Right now, CBC treats its website as if it were an industrial by-product of the broadcast networks, like a slaughterhouse that sells off the bones for fertilizer and the hooves for glue. Itâ€™s an afterthought.

From where I sit, this feels accurate.
