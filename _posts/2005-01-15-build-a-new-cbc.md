Earlier this week, I received a mass email from Ian Morrison at the [Friends of Canadian Broadcasting](http://www.friends.ca/). This is what he had to say:

> FRIENDS has learned that the federal government is poised to announce a new round of budget cuts, despite its $9 billion surplus. CBC is a target, even though two House of Commons Committees &#8212; Finance and Heritage &#8212; have called for increased stable funding for CBC.
> 
> Unless we act now, CBC could suffer yet another in a long line of funding cuts that have taken a tremendous toll, especially at the grassroots.

Tonight I took a few minutes to write a letter to the Prime Minister, expressing my concerns. I encourage you to do the same. The [Action Centre](http://www.friends.ca/grassroots5/) makes it easy, addressing it to the PM, [Liza Frulla](http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/min/index_e.cfm), Minister of Canadian Heritage, and your local MP.
