Yesterday I went down to the CBC to track narration for my polka dot piece. The whole thing took less than fifteen minutes. I did a read of my script, handed over my clips, shook [Nick](http://www.cbc.ca/dnto/nick.html)&#8216;s hand, and was out of there. This is the first piece I&#8217;ve done for the CBC where I haven&#8217;t actually cut everything together myself in Dalet. Though I had less control over the final product, I guess I&#8217;ll get to hear it with fresh ears when it airs.

So then, tune into CBC Radio One this Saturday afternoon between 3 and 4 (your local time) to hear me talk for a few minutes about polka dots.

Sadly, the DNTO email preview got my name wrong:
