We&#8217;re less than 10 hours away from the expiry of the CBC&#8217;s 72-hour lockout notice period. I keep checking [cbcnegotiations.ca](http://www.cbcnegotiations.ca) and [cmg.ca](http://www.cmg.ca).

Last week, a colleague commented that the CMG/CBC negotiations seemed like a &#8220;bunch of teenagers bickering.&#8221; I think it would have been interesting to set up a parallel set of negotiations with a bunch of teenagers.

Who do you think would come to an agreement first?
