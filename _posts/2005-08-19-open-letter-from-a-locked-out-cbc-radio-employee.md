Just read Caitlin&#8217;s [Open Letter From a Locked-Out CBC Radio Employee](http://open.touchbasic.com/journal/open-letter-from-a-locked-out-cbc-radio-employee/):

> The CBC is only as good as its programming, and therefore only as good as the people who create that programming. Having zero security and always worrying about where we will work next week means we can&#8217;t fully concentrate on our jobs. We can&#8217;t be as creative and fully engaged with our work as we&#8217;d like to because we are always wondering if we should be looking somewhere else for a real job.
