If you missed yesterday&#8217;s Soundtrack of Our (Locked Out) Lives on CKDU, you can listen to an archived version at: <http://129.173.68.238/20050830.14.33-16.01.mp3>. Also, an interesting discussion about the program is going on in the [halifaxlocals](http://media.locals.ca/localsconf/viewtopic.php?t=35976) forum.
