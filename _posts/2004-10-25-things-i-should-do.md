Monday is my day off.

Last night, I started to make notes on my Sean Ward tape, listening to the stuff I collected when I spent the afternoon with him as he sold his comic books on Queen Street. Today, the plan is to listen to the two hours I recorded in his his studio, and make a couple more pages of notes. I&#8217;m also going to call the [Silver Snail](http://www.silversnail.com) to see if someone will talk to me about &#8220;how to become a successful comic book artist.&#8221;

I should also call Richard, my polka music guy.

I should also start my BRD303 paper. I&#8217;m comparing two CDs recorded by Ian McGettigan: Rick of the Skins&#8217; _[Here Comes the Weekend](http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/r/rickoftheskins-here.shtml)_ and Plaskett&#8217;s _[Truthfully, Truthfully](http://www.maplemusic.com/product.asp?dept%5Fid=1621&pf%5Fid=1620%2D02&lang=EN)_. According to their answering machine, Ian is living in Toronto with Rob Benvie. He was nice enough to do a phone interview with me last week, so I&#8217;ll have a shiny interview disc to hand in with my paper. Now I just have to write the thing.

Gary Gould from the Ryerson Journalism school gave me the name of a friend of his at CBC Radio. I should email him. And set up lunch with Gary.

Got a call on Friday afternoon from The Arts Report&#8217;s [Joe Cummings](http://www.radio.cbc.ca/programs/artsreport/host.html). Returned his call this morning, left voicemail.

Lots of things on the go.
