I promised a few people that I&#8217;d send them copies of my recent appearances on [GO](http://www.cbc.ca/go). But instead, I&#8217;m putting them online for anyone who&#8217;s interested.

From February 23, 2008, here&#8217;s a piece I did on what would happen if I applied the time-stretching technology I used everyday on audio to my personal life: [audio:http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-dm_slowingdowntime919.mp3] 

I&#8217;ll post my March 1 appearance tomorrow.
