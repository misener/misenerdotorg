I&#8217;m not usually one to post videos, but today, via the [Radio3 blog](http://radio3.cbc.ca/blogs/2007/06/Expose-Yourself-on-CBC-and-Win-up-to-25K), I found a great short by [Nathan Fielder](http://www.NathanFielder.com). It&#8217;s called _Widget_, and it&#8217;s hosted on the new [Exposure](http://exposure.cbc.ca/video/widget) site.

The scripting and pacing reminds me so much of my favourite cartoon, [Home Movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Movies_(TV_series)).


  


Conceptually, I liked [ZeD](http://zed.cbc.ca/), but found the execution and quality hit-or-miss. I&#8217;m keen to see how Exposure pans out for CBCÂ  when it launches in July.
