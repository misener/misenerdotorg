I make my (triumphant?) return to CBC&#8217;s Saturday airwaves this February 21st. I&#8217;ll be on both [Go](http://cbc.ca/go) (talking about how to beef up your manly-quotient) and [DNTO](http://cbc.ca/go) (talking about the unfortunately-named Adolph Fitler).

Check your local listings. Or whatever.

**Update:** Here&#8217;s the audio from DNTO: [audio:http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-misener_adolphfitler779.mp3]
