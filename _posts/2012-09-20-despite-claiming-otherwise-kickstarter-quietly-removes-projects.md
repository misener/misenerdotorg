&#8220;Transparency is vital on Kickstarter.&#8221;

[Or so says their FAQ](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creator%20questions#WhatIsMyRespForAnswQuesFromBackAndNonb). But if you look closely enough, Kickstarter isn&#8217;t living up to its own transparency promises.

It seems that Kickstarter has quietly removed several projects from its site, despite claiming that they never do this. [Again, from their FAQ](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creator%20questions#HowLongDoesAProjRemaOnKick):

> **How long does a project remain on Kickstarter?**
> 
> Forever! Projects are not closed or taken down, they remain on site for reference and transparency.
> 
> For the same reasons, projects cannot be deleted, even if they were canceled or unsuccessful. Please note that deleting your Kickstarter account will not delete your project.

But here&#8217;s the thing. Kickstarter has taken down several projects. The most recent example comes from [Vinted Goods](http://vintedgoods.com/), a handbag company that raised more than $70,000 on Kickstarter. [They&#8217;re claiming](http://vintedgoods.com/pr) that Kickstarter suspended their campaign just 10 hours before it was scheduled to end.

Indeed, as I write this, the [Vinted Goods](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/446805249/vinted-bags-and-leather-goods-essentials-for-explo) Kickstarter page simply says:

> Sorry, this project is no longer available.

Vinted Goods isn&#8217;t alone.

The [Drone &#8220;DMND&#8221; Controller](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1032973938/dmnd-drone-controller) campaign from Evolution Controllers also says &#8220;Sorry, this project is no longer available.&#8221;

As does the ironically named [F.I.N.A.O.= Failure is NEVER an option](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/939496554/finao-failure-is-never-an-option) campaign.

And [Gubble 3D: New Retro Maze Videogame](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1479679929/gubble-3d-new-retro-maze-videogame-by-ex-atari-des).

In fact, if you [search Google for Kickstarter projects containing &#8220;Sorry, this project is no longer available&#8221;](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q="Sorry%2C%20this%20project%20is%20no%20longer%20available."#q=%22Sorry%2C+this+project+is+no+longer+available.%22+site%3Akickstarter.com&hl=en&prmd=imvns&filter=0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&biw=1301&bih=651) it seems there are a small handful of projects that have been quietly removed.

If all Kickstarter projects &#8220;remain on site for reference and transparency&#8221; and if transparency really is vital at Kickstarter, I&#8217;d love to know where these project pages went.

**Update 21 September 2012 09:50 CEST:** Last night, a representative from Kickstarter reached out with this statement:

> Like any site, Kickstarter removes content due to intellectual property disputes, inappropriate content, and Terms of Use violations.

Looking through archived versions of the projects Kickstarter removed, there&#8217;s definitely an undercurrent of IP disputes.
