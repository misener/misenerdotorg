Just stumbled across [Jennifer](http://jenkew.blog.cyberlogic.net/blog/)&#8216;s blog. She touches on an interesting phenomenon, one that a colleague and I discussed earlier today:

> &#8230; eventually a few of us hang our signs in the trees to throw around a Frisbee. I feel guilty after about half an hour, so I put my sign back on to do the long boring walk some more.

There seem to be unwritten rules and expectations on the picket line. But where do these feelings of obligation come from? Besides serving as a public display, what the is _function_ of picketing? Why do I feel guilty when I stop to sit down or have a drink?
