A few months ago, I picked up a pair of V-MODA vibe duo earphones. I liked them a lot.

Until they stopped working at the gym tonight. The left side just kept flaking out.

Knowing that the earphones are under warranty, I submitted a ticket to their [warranty service](https://shop.v-moda.com/t-returns.aspx). I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that the third result in a [Google search for v-moda warranty](http://www.google.ca/search?q=v-moda+warranty) is a Get Satisfaction thread called &#8220;[V-Moda&#8217;s warranty is bull!@#$](http://getsatisfaction.com/v-moda/topics/v_modas_warranty_is_bull).&#8221;

Fingers crossed.

**Update:** Got an email from V-MODA:

> We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced and will be more than happy to send you a replacement pair. All that we ask is that you send the defective pair back to us at the address listed below. Do not worry about sending the accessories, all we need are your defective headphones! Once we receive your return, we will be able to proceed with the replacement process. Please be sure to note Ticket # (XXXXXXXX)on the shipment and let us know, IN DETAIL, the reason for your return.

**Update 2:** Apparently V-MODA has acknowledged that their Vibe Duo jack design is faulty, and is [quietly relanching a redesigned pair](http://gizmodo.com/5048667/new-v+moda-vibe-and-vibe-duo-jacks-mean-fewer-dead-headphones-hopefully).

**Update 3:** I returned my headphones, and emailed V-MODA with the tracking number. I also asked if I would receive a replacement pair with the new jack design. They replied:

> If you own the Vibe Duo&#8217;s you will be getting back the ones with the newly designed plug. If you own the Vibes the newly designed plug for those will be avaiable in late October.

**Update 4:** This just in:

> We have processed your replacement order. Your order # is [REDACTED]. You will receive a confirmation email when your order has been shipped.
> 
> Thank you for your patience and for being a part of the V-MODA culture. 

We&#8217;ll wait and see&#8230;
