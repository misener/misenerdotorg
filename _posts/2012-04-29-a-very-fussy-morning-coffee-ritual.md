One of the great luxuries of a sabbatical year in France is time.

I have time now like I&#8217;ve never had it before. Time to go for a stroll, time to sit in a cafe for hours on end practicing French&#8230;

Most notably though, I now have time to make coffee in a very fussy way.

Back in January, based on a recommendation from the fine folks at [Cafe Mokxa](http://www.cafemokxa.com/), [Jenna](http://ahbon.ca) and I bought an [Aeropress](http://www.aeropress.com/). That was fussy enough on its own.Â But then, last week, Jenna brought home a [hand-crank coffee grinder](http://www.hario.cc/MSCS-2TB.html). Now it&#8217;s just ridiculous.

This morning, simply to document my current coffee setup, I shot and edited a [quick video](http://vimeo.com/41239123):



It&#8217;s a simple thing. A small pleasure.

I consider myself very lucky to be able to indulge in it.
