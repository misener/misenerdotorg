First, there were [two bananas on the dashboard](http://phoneblog.misener.org/two-bananas-on-the-dashboard).

Then along came Dom, with [two clementines on the counter](http://domideas.posterous.com/two-clementines-on-the-counter-misener). With some help from my in-laws, I countered with [two pine cones by the fireplace](http://phoneblog.misener.org/domideas-two-pine-cones-by-the-fireplace). Not to be outdone, Dom found [two shopping carts against the wall](http://domideas.posterous.com/two-shopping-carts-against-the-wall-misener). Then, near Leamington, Jenna and I drove by [two Volkswagen Beetles in a snowdrift](http://phoneblog.misener.org/two-volkswagen-beetles-in-a-snowdrift).

Back inside, Dom placed [two powerplugs on some plywood](http://domideas.posterous.com/two-powerplugs-on-some-plywood-2thingsby1thin). And most recently, [Andrew](https://twitter.com/AFORGRAVE) managed to capture [two circles on the table](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aforgrave/5284436566/).

You can play, too. Here&#8217;s how:

  1. Find two like things
  2. Make a short cameraphone video of them, singing
  3. Tweet the link with **#2thingsby1thing**
