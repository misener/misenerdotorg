It seems like most of my time these days is spent trying to make myself sound impressive and clever.

I&#8217;m working on a total of five pitches/applications, including my [internship](http://thislife.org/pages/faq_extras/internships.html) application for the summer 2005 term on This American Life (due February 1), a pitch for my senior practicum project (due this Friday), a simultaneous pitch to [Outfront](http://www.cbc.ca/outfront/), an idea for the CBC Radio program development group (I heard from Chris Boyce today), and possibly a [submission](http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/submissions.html) to Ideas (also due this Friday).

And by way of an update to my [entry about radio scoring](http://danmisener.blogspot.com/2004/12/radio-scoring.html), here are some more soundtracks I&#8217;ve been enjoying: Jon Brion&#8217;s work on [I Heart Huckabees](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:zl5j8qmxbtz4), [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:6gd4vwnqa9ek), and [Magnolia](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:rs9gs38la39g), plus Mark Mothersbaugh tracks on [The Life Aquatic](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:34rz287q058a).
