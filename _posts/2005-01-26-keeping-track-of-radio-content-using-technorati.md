I&#8217;ve recently been digging [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) (Peter describes it as &#8220;[Google for weblogs](http://ruk.ca/article/2572)&#8220;). I&#8217;ve set up a [watchlist for CBC Radio](http://www.technorati.com/watchlists/rss.html?wid=28114), so everytime somebody blogs about our national public broadcaster, it shows up in my [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com).

And tonight, I learned about Technorati [tags](http://www.technorati.com/help/tags.html), which allow bloggers to categorize their posts. Apparently you can search by tag, so I tried to set up a watchlist for [tag:radio](http://www.technorati.com/watchlists/rss.html?wid=31556). Presuming it works, I&#8217;ll get radio photos from Flickr, links from del.icio.us and Furl, and blog posts from Technorati, all in one feed categorized by human beings.

I like when information I want comes right to me.

**Update:** the watchlist I created for &#8220;tag:radio&#8221; kept coming up empty, so I emailed the folks at Technorati, and they told me that tag watchlists haven&#8217;t been implemented yet.

Their full reply, including a workaround, follows:

> There&#8217;s one thing you can do in the meantime: You can create a watchlist on URL for the tag, for example:
> 
> http://technorati.com/tag/radio
> 
> The limitation is that you&#8217;ll only get posts with Technorati tags in them, not blog categories. But perhaps you&#8217;ll find this useful until we get our act together :-)
