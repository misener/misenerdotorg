My CBC tech column this week is all about The Atlantic&#8217;s new Twitter-based book club: #1book140. A version is up at cbc.ca/tech and below for posterity. You can listen to the audio version or [download the MP3](http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/podcasts/misenerontech_20110531_75338.mp3). [audio:http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/podcasts/misenerontech\_20110531\_75338.mp3] 

Even better, I’d sure appreciate it if you’d [subscribe to the brand new Misener on Tech podcast in iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=438669328).

Online book clubs are nothing new. [CBC has one](http://www.cbc.ca/books/bookclub/). [NPR has one](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134270828/npr-book-club-for-march-cutting-for-stone). [The Guardian has one](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/series/bookclub). Until recently, [Oprah Winfrey had one](http://www.oprah.com/book_club.html). And long before the web, the rec.arts.books usenet groups were home to literary discussion of all kinds. But a new initiative from The Atlantictakes the online book club and adds a twist.

1book140 is a monthly &#8220;read-along&#8221; that launches June 1, and its defining characteristic is that it takes place almost exclusively on Twitter, organized around the [#1book140](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%231book140)hashtag.

&#8220;Twitter is the thumping heart of 1book140. It&#8217;s where most of the conversation will take place,&#8221; says author and journalism professor Jeff Howe.

1book140 is the follow-up to Howe&#8217;s 2010 project [One Book, One Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/1b1t2010). Howe told me that with One Book, One Twitter, &#8220;12,000 people from all around the world read Neil Gaiman&#8217;s American Gods.&#8221;

Margaret Atwood&#8217;s The Blind Assassin has been chosen as the first title to be discussed in 1book140, and structure of the online conversation will benefit from lessons learned during Howe&#8217;s previous effort. For instance, avoiding spoilers: This time, Howe says, &#8220;[we&#8217;ll] divide discussion up by chapters so that people aren&#8217;t giving away plot points.&#8221; This is accomplished by using hashtags for each chapter of The Blind Assassin: #1b140\_1, #1b140\_2, #1b140_3, etc.

## Why Twitter?

When I first heard about this project, I had to wonder: isn&#8217;t Twitter simply too short? Is it possible to have a meaningful, nuanced discussion about a piece of literature through a medium that puts so much value on brevity and pith?

According to Howe, that&#8217;s not really the goal. &#8220;What you don&#8217;t get is long, meditative, reflective discussion. You have to think of Twitter as an episodic medium. If you have a complex argument to make, it&#8217;s something that you break down into bursts of 140 characters.&#8221;

For Howe, discussing a novel on Twitter mirrors the conversational back-and-forth nature of a meatspace book club. &#8220;If you think about it, when you&#8217;re sitting at a book party, you may not say a whole lot more than could be expressed in 140 characters before someone else jumps in and gives their 140-character response. Then you start again.&#8221;

The episodic nature of Twitter offers two things, says Howe: scalability and spontaneity.

Scalability means that you can have many people from many places all engaging with a book at the same time.

When it comes to spontaneity, &#8220;there&#8217;s an ability for people to log on, day or night, and there&#8217;s always people discussing.&#8221;

The spontaneity of Twitter is something I can completely relate to. There&#8217;s something very compelling about the &#8220;now-ness&#8221; of Twitter. For me, the now-ness is most apparent during large-scale events that unfold in real time: protests in Egypt, election results, and sports. If you&#8217;ve never watched Saturday Night Live with Twitter open, it&#8217;s worth a try. As videoblogger Steve Garfield says, &#8220;Watching TV with Twitter open is like having all my friends on the couch with me.&#8221;

## Turning books into events

Though I&#8217;m not completely sold on the value of Twitter as a medium for literary discussion, I completely understand the impulse to use it to turn books — static, fixed works — into events, complete with real-time analysis, commentary and arguments.

Now, I would be remiss if I failed to confess that aside from a youthful stint in a summer reading program at the Sackville Public Library (for which I was awarded stickers), I have never been a member of a real, face-to-face, sit-down book club. But the desire to join a topic-specific club isn&#8217;t lost on me. And I recognize that the now-ness of social media, coupled with a feeling of mass participation, can prompt people to reconsider older works that they mightn&#8217;t otherwise.

For instance, when the hosts of [one of my favourite podcasts](http://5by5.tv/talkshow) decided to watch all the James Bond films in order, one per week, I started watching along with them. Am I a die-hard Bond fan? No. Was I terribly interested in re-watching Dr. No, From Russia With Love, andGoldfinger? No. But the feeling of &#8220;playing along at home&#8221; was enough to entice me. As I watched, I felt like I&#8217;d joined a sort of club.

For me, that&#8217;s part of what&#8217;s so appealing about keeping one eye on Twitter and the other on a TV set. Or why joining a global, real-time book club sounds fun. Or why I&#8217;d fathom re-watching cheesy James Bond films from the 1960s.

In an increasingly on-demand, random-access world — when I can watch, read, or listen to whatever I want, whenever I want —there&#8217;s still value in a shared collective experience. I think the success of 1book140, and projects like it, will depend on their ability to tap into that.
