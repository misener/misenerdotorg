Jowi Taylor, speaking at [PAB09](http://www.podcastersacrossborders.com/pab2009/) about his award-winning radio series, [The Wire](http://www.cbc.ca/thewire/):

> Our idea was to treat content as a composition, and to treat the listeners as active participants in the listening experience.

If you haven&#8217;t heard [The Wire](http://www.cbc.ca/thewire/) (or the follow-up series, [The Nerve](http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/features/theNerve/)) find a copy **now** and listen. If you can&#8217;t find a copy, [email me](mailto:dan@misener.org) and I can probably help.
