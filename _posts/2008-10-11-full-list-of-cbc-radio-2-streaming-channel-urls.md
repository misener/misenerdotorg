**Update, 11 April 2012:** This page is old, and the URLs don&#8217;t work anymore. You&#8217;re probably actually looking for my [Full list of CBC Music direct URLs](http://misener.org/archives/1266 "Full list of CBC Music direct URLs") instead.

<!--more-->

**Update:** CBC now has official lists:

  * [Radio1 Direct URLs](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/includes/directr1.html)
  * [Radio2 Direct URLs](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/includes/directr2.html)

&#8212;

Along with the re-launch of Radio 2, CBC created four new streaming &#8220;genre&#8221; channels: **Classical**, **Jazz**, **Canadian Composers**, and **Canadian Songwriters**. You may have heard the heavy advertisement for them on both CBC Radio 1 and 2. To hear these new channels, you have to listen at the Radio 2 website, or listen in iTunes under &#8220;Radio&#8221; in the sidebar.

But what do you do if you don&#8217;t want to leave a browser window open? Or if you&#8217;d rather stream using VLC, or WinAmp or something?

Because I can&#8217;t seem to find one anywhere else (including CBC&#8217;s own Windows-Media centric [Direct CBC.ca URLs for listening to CBC Radio](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/streams.html) page), I&#8217;ve put together a full list of CBC Radio 2 streaming &#8220;channel&#8221; URLs list here:

Classical
:   <http://atl2.fla.abacast.com/cbc-canadianclassicalhi-192>

Jazz
:   <http://atl2.fla.abacast.com/cbc-jazzhi-192>

Canadian Composers
:   <http://atl2.fla.abacast.com/cbc-composershi-192>

Canadian Songwriters
:   <http://atl2.fla.abacast.com/cbc-songwriterhi-192>

### How did I find these?

  1. In the &#8220;Radio&#8221; section of iTunes, I browsed for each of the four channels
  2. I dragged each of the stations into a new iTunes playlist
  3. In the playlist I right clicked on each item, I clicked &#8220;Edit URL&#8221; and copied the URL (For example, the Canadian Songwriters URL was [http://pri.kts-af.net/redir/index.pls?esid=6ae4b0420afe423a4f04585b4c0b1ed1&url\_no=1&client\_id=7&uid=68efed4d03ec7e45fd3978262c107180&clicksrc=xml](http://pri.kts-af.net/redir/index.pls?esid=6ae4b0420afe423a4f04585b4c0b1ed1&url_no=1&client_id=7&uid=68efed4d03ec7e45fd3978262c107180&clicksrc=xml))
  4. I pasted that URL into Firefox, which downloaded a .pls file
  5. I opened each .pls file in Textedit, which gave me the above URLs.

### Interesting:

  * Abacast ([abacast.com](http://abacast.com)) is an American company
  * It looks like the Live Streaming service [costs either $395 or $695](http://www.abacast.com/products/livestreaming.php) per month per channel, depending on the package
  * Though the URLs (and iTunes Radio listings) suggest the bitrate is 192 kbps, my copy of VLC reports otherwise, between 112 and 160 kbps. Perhaps that&#8217;s a limitation of my broadband connection, though.
  * Abacast lists [complete listener statistics](http://www.abacast.com/products/stats.php) as part of its streaming audio packages. I wonder how many people are listening. I wonder if these numbers will ever become as public as BBM reports.
