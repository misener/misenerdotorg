This past weekend, Jenna and I visited the Spectacle eyeglasses stores in the Distillery. Jenna&#8217;s looking for new frames, and I&#8217;m in need of a new eye doctor. When I asked the guy behind the counter if he could suggest an optometrist near my office, he wrote this down on a business card:

> Dr. Raja
    
> 416-362-2020
    
> TD Centre

Check out that phone number. I love little details like that.
