This summer, I worked on two pieces for the CBC Radio summer show [Lost and Found](http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/program/?program=Lost+%26+Found), hosted by Matt Rainnie in Charlottetown.Â I just put the finishing touches on the second piece today, and the first piece airs this Saturday, on the &#8220;Stuff&#8230; Lost and Found&#8221; episode:

Davey Rothbart is making a living publishing the scraps of paper people lose or leave behind in Found Magazine. And we tell you what the latest trend is in big concert ticket sales. Those mega-line ups may be a thing of the past. We&#8217;re talking Stuff&#8230;.Lost and Found with host Matt Rainnie.</blockquote>

> Mine is the interview with Davy Rothbart, creator of [Found Magazine](http://www.foundmagazine.com). It was exciting to do, for two reasons. First, Davy&#8217;s a bit of a hero of mine. Second, I really enjoyed listening to Lost and Found last summer during its first season, andÂ it was really nice to be asked to contribute this year.
