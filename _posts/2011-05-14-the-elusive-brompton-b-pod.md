But how to transport the Brompton without damaging it? The [Brompton catalog](http://www.brompton.co.uk/technical/spares/category.asp?q=C2) lists something that I&#8217;ve had my eye on for a while: the &#8220;B Pod, a semi-rigid flight case; comes with castors and handle.&#8221; And after reading [this Flying with a Brompton](http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-218198.html) forum thread, a hard case sounds like a good idea.

However, actually finding a B Pod proves difficult. No stores carry them.

Alas, when I asked Brompton about B Pod availability, this was the response:

> Thanks for your enquiry, it is with great regret that I let you know the B Pod will not be available this year.
> 
> Having first offered this product in 2010 (albeit as a mid-year launch), we have unfortunately been let down by an unreliable supplier which has lead us to the difficult decision to cancel production.
> 
> We continue to have great faith in the B Pod, which we know was set to be a very popular product addition, and will be looking for a solution in the coming months.

Eric from [Curbside](http://store.curbside.on.ca/) says that though the B Pod isn&#8217;t available, the Brompton soft case works just fine:

> I&#8217;ve travelled tons with a Brompton before that (including the Brompton World Championships!). Never had a problem. The bike protects itself, the case just keeps the frame scratch free (and extra protected). 

In the meantime, I&#8217;m curious about [this third-party Brompton hard case from B&W](http://www.calhouncycle.com/ProductCart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=138&idproduct=1252). Looks nice, but $350 is a little crazy for a single-purpose piece of luggage.
