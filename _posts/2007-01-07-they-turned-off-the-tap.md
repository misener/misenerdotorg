Since moving into my new apartment last August, I&#8217;ve enjoyed free WiFi courtesy of one of my neighbours. I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s altruism or ignorance, but judging by their router&#8217;s SSID (&#8220;default&#8221;), my money&#8217;s on the latter. Anyway, for the past few months, it&#8217;s been great &#8212; a nice, strong, reliable signal. For free!

But the day I got back from New Year&#8217;s in Windsor, I realized something had changed. My old friend &#8220;default?&#8221; Encrypted! What was I to do?

  * [Hack the WEP encryption](http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-1021256519470427962) with Kismac?
  * Hook up a complicated system of routers in my closet to borrow and redistribute another neighbour&#8217;s open signal?
  * Go without the internet for a while and see what better things I can find to do with my time?

After some thought, I decided it might just be best to actually _pay for my own internet access_. Go figure. Now, as far as I know, there are only two companies that offer high-speed in Toronto: Bell and Rogers. I hate them both, but of the two, I hate Rogers the least. So, from Jenna&#8217;s laptop, I surfed on over to the Rogers site to see what the damage would be. I clicked on &#8220;Internet Services,&#8221; then &#8220;Promotions.&#8221; I typed in my postal code so the site could &#8220;provide [me] with the right products and services.&#8221;

This took me to a page with a list of specials. One of them looked pretty good:

> **Rogers Yahoo! Hi-Speed Internet EXPRESS**
> 
>   * Save $3 per month for 12 months!
>   * Receive $10 rebate with your online order
>   * Free Basic Installation
>   * No term commitment required

Free installation? A discount for ordering online? No contract? &#8220;Hey,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;maybe paying for legit Internet won&#8217;t be so bad. Sign me up!&#8221; So I clicked &#8220;Order Now.&#8221; It took me to a page that asked for my name and address. Hurriedly, I typed them in, and clicked &#8220;Continue.&#8221; Then, this:

</center>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I couldn&#8217;t order Rogers high-speed because they were &#8220;currently experiencing system problems.&#8221;

Wow, Rogers. You&#8217;re really inspiring confidence in your _**internet service product**_ with that one.

Yeesh.
