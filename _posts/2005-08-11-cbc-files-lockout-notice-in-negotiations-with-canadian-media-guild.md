> CBC FILES LOCKOUT NOTICE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADIAN MEDIA GUILD
> 
> This evening, CBC made the difficult decision to provide the CMG with 72-hour lockout notice under the Canada Labour Code. The 72-hour notice period expires on Monday, August 15th at 12:01 a.m. if an agreement is not reached.
> 
> Earlier today, CBC presented a revised comprehensive offer to CMG â€“ one that is fair, competitive and realistic, one that recognizes the CBCâ€™s business pressures and need for change, and that acknowledges the needs and aspirations of employees represented by CMG. It is hoped that discussions will accelerate so that we can reach agreement on all of the outstanding issues before the deadline.
> 
> This is not a decision we took lightly. Despite CBCâ€™s comprehensive offer from earlier today, no language has been agreed to since Sunday, August 7th. This is disappointing, and has given us no alternative but to serve lockout notice.
> 
> CBC doesnâ€™t want a work stoppage and we are extremely disappointed to have to take this action. However, after almost 15 months of negotiations, our key issues remain unresolved â€“ issues which are crucial to CBCâ€™s success as Canadaâ€™s national public broadcaster and as a well-managed company in a competitive media marketplace. For more information on our key issues, read our backgrounders at http://www.cbcnegotiations.ca/English/CBC-Issues&#8211;Interests.html.
> 
> This does not automatically mean that a work stoppage will occur at that time. We are still at the bargaining table and CBC remains committed to reaching a negotiated collective agreement with the union.
> 
> We recognize and regret the impact that this may have on our employees and our audiences and we remain hopeful that a deal can be reached by the deadline. To that end, CBC remains committed to trying to reach a negotiated collective agreement prior to the deadline.
