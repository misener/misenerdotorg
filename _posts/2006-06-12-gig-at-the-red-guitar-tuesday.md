Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll play a [gig](http://www.theredguitar.com/june06.html#june13) with my friend [Ainsley McNeaney](http://www.ainsleymcneaney.com/home.html) (and a pile of other bona-fide musician types, including Dean Pomeroy, Tim Francom, Miguel Malaco, Kristine Grey, Cait Boyle and Mohsin Bhujwalla).

You can listen to some of Ainsley&#8217;s tunes on [her MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/ainsleymcneaney) account.

It happens Tuesday, June 13 at the Red Guitar in Toronto. It&#8217;s an early show with 2 sets, starting at 7:00. Details at [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.org/event/83631/).
