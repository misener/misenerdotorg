As [Ouimet observes](http://teamakers.blogspot.com/2008/01/roundup-of-new-cbc-tv-season.html), much of the CBC&#8217;s winter television lineup is available for download via Bittorrent, thanks to some thieving television pirates.

But what you may not know is that [The Border](http://tvrss.net/search/?show_name=The+Border&show_name_exact=true), [Sophie](http://tvrss.net/search/?show_name=Sophie&show_name_exact=true), and [jPod](http://tvrss.net/search/?show_name=jPod&show_name_exact=true) (but not MVP) each have corresponding RSS feeds on [tvRSS.net](http://tvrss.net/).

What does this mean?

If you paste the search-based RSS feed for each show into a program like the free, open-source [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/), you&#8217;ve essentially subscribed to the show, and new episodes will be downloaded auto-magically as they&#8217;re released.

Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if this kind of activity was condoned?

Miro is [about to announce their first round of co-branded players](http://www.getmiro.com/blog/2008/01/announcing-miro-11-dramatically-faster-bittorrent/). If CBC Television really wanted to transform itself into a forward-thinking public broadcasting service, they&#8217;d be on the list. You&#8217;d download a CBC-branded player preloaded with subscriptions to the whole lineup. Shows would be distributed cheaply, and live on the hard drives of the taxpayers who funded them. The licensing would all be worked out, and everyone would get paid.

But I&#8217;m not holding my breath.
