Today I spent the day in Scarborough with the good folks from [CBL](http://www.cbc.ca/toronto/). We were taping a special town hall called &#8220;Between Two Worlds&#8221; all about teen identity. It&#8217;s part of the CBC&#8217;s week-long [The Teen Age](http://www.cbc.ca/theteenage/) programming. We were at [L&#8217;Amoreaux Collegiate](http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/lamoreaux/), and the students were incredible &#8212; articulate, thoughtful, and engaged.

I was an &#8220;audience rover,&#8221; basically a human microphone stand. A student would raise their hand, and I&#8217;d run over as quickly as possible. I got to wear a red shirt and a headset. Several of the kids told me repeatedly that they thought I looked like [Napoleon Dynamite](http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/napoleondynamite/epk/index.php).

It was a blast.
