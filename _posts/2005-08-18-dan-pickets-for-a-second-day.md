Today was my second day on the picket line, and my first full 8 hour shift. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever drank more water. Or worn more SPF 45 sunscreen. I arrived at 9:00 AM, and smiled when a colleague piped up, &#8220;I saw Dan Misener&#8217;s blog last night.&#8221;

The morning passed quickly. I got a chance to walk and talk with some people I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while, including the not-back-from-vacation-but-here-for-support Tony Doucette. Also chatted about [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) and [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) with [Sue Braiden](http://www.tinman.org/sue/). For the most part, conversations were still CBC and lockout-related. But hey, when you&#8217;re walking around the CBC building with your CBC co-workers during a CBC lockout, it&#8217;s hard to focus on much else.

Other local unions dropped by with treats (iced cappuccino!), including [CAW Local 195](http://www.cawlocal.ca/195/) and the [Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association](http://www.oecta.on.ca/index.htm). Thanks!

I consider myself lucky. I&#8217;m young, and I&#8217;m portable, and I can live cheap. Most of what I own here fits in a couple of large Rubbermaid totes. I don&#8217;t have a spouse, kids, car payments, or a mortgage. Our strike pay is pretty good, and if the lockout continues, I&#8217;ll be able to eke out a humble existence. I&#8217;m not so worried about myself or those close to retirement &#8212; we&#8217;ll be OK. It&#8217;s my colleagues and friends _with_ spouses, kids, cars, and mortgages that I&#8217;m worried about. My fingers are crossed.
