This has already been practically everywhere, but since it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been [wishing for](http://misener.org/archives/252) for a long time, I&#8217;ll mention that [CBC TV is planning to release television programs via Bittorrent](http://www.cbc.ca/nextprimeminister/blog/2008/03/canadas_next_great_prime_minis.html). Let&#8217;s hope that they&#8217;ll actually generate a feed that&#8217;s compatible with [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/).

Not that I&#8217;m particularly interested in the program they&#8217;re offering ([Canada&#8217;s Next Great Prime Minister](http://www.cbc.ca/nextprimeminister/index.html)), but this is a huge step in the right direction. Now if they&#8217;d only release jPod and Sophie, two of the shows [I already &#8220;illegally&#8221; download](http://misener.org/archives/312) via Bittorrent.
