Once again, I&#8217;m teaching Radio Production (or rather, [Media Production &#8211; Audio](http://www.ryerson.ca/rta/studenthandbook/courses/courseoutlines/outlinepdfs/BDC101%20AUDIO%20F06.pdf)) at Ryerson this Fall.

I start this Thursday.

Looking forward to meeting a whole new class of budding radio producers.
