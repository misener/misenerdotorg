Looks like [Tod](http://radio.blogware.com/blog/Events/CBCLabourDispute), [Yvan](http://sidewalkguy.blogspot.com/), [Ouimet](http://teamakers.blogspot.com/), and I are now listed on [cmgtoronto.ca](http://cmgtoronto.ca/) under &#8220;Blogs.&#8221;

I plan to spend this coming weekend in Toronto. And since CMG members don&#8217;t have to picket where they work, I may stay a few extra days and join my Toronto colleagues on the line.

A special hello to the folks at CBL and [Metro Morning](http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/) (that link won&#8217;t work, by the way, because most individual program pages are down).
