This week, on my weekly CBC tech column, I explain what bothers me about the word &#8220;hacker.&#8221;

And for the podcast version this week, I tried something a little different. In addition to the 6-7 minute hit I do with CBC afternoon shows, I included tape from two (much) longer interviews: one with [Steve Hoefer](http://grathio.com/), and one with Site3&#8217;s [Jonathan Guberman](http://upnotnorth.net/). I&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d have a listen and let me know what you think of this expanded format. [audio:http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/podcasts/misenerontech\_20110614\_99386.mp3]
