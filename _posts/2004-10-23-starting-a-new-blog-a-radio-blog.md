So Iâ€™ve started a new blog. Starting is always the hardest part.

Posts, I suppose, will fall into one of three main categories.

  1. What Iâ€™m listening to 
      * What Iâ€™m working on 
          * How the hell Iâ€™m going to get work once I graduate </ol> 
            This first entry fits under #2. Consider it a backgrounder.
            
            I am working on two projects for the CBC. Hooray!
            
            One is for [Metro Morning](http://toronto.cbc.ca/metromorning/): a profile piece about [Sean Ward](http://www.seanward.net), an autobiographical comic book artist who sells his work on Queen Street. Iâ€™ve got all my tape dubbed. I have about three and a half hours, which has to be boiled down to maybe five minutes. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be transcribing everything. At this point, I just need to find the time to listen back, write a script, and get it vetted. Piece of cake.
            
            Another is for [DNTO](http://www.opera.cbc.ca): a little feature about what Iâ€™ve been calling â€œtrend piggybacking.â€ Basically, Iâ€™m going to go out and figure out what polka dots have to do with polka music. I already know the answer, but the fun is in the finding. Iâ€™ve heard back from folks at the [Polka Dot Door](http://www.tvtome.com/tvtome/servlet/ShowMainServlet/showid-11277/Polka_Dot_Door/), a [polka band](http://dynamixband.polkaweb.com/), and I have the numbers for a couple textile/fashion people from school.
            
            Progress reports to follow.
