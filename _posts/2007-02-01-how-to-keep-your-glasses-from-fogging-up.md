So it&#8217;s the first day of February, one of the coldest months of the year. To mark the occasion, here&#8217;s a tip for keeping your eyeglasses from fogging up when coming indoors from the cold:

**Walk in backwards.**

I have no idea why this works, but it does. It&#8217;s a trick I learned when I was a kid delivering newspapers in Lower Sackville. My glasses would always fog up when I entered people&#8217;s homes on cold nights to collect paper money. One night, one of my bespectacled customers suggested I try it.

People have been looking at me funny ever since.
