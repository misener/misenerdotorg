My pal [Tom](http://tomlucier.wordpress.com/) gave me a ukulele for Christmas. To me, it&#8217;s wonderful. To [Jenna](http://twitter.com/zuschlag), it&#8217;s irritating.

So then, I can&#8217;t tell you how happy I was to discover the [Corktown Ukulele Jam](http://torontoukes.com/). It started about a month ago, and is held every Wednesday at the Dominion pub on Queen (a five-minute walk from our apartment). Last night, I went for the first time with Jenna and [Rae](http://twitter.com/raeannejuniper).



Steve and David, the organizers, were welcoming and knowledgeable. Someone played a Jonathan Coulton cover ([Re: Your Brains](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/03/24/thing-a-week-26-re-your-brains/)). It was kind of, sort of, like going to ukulele heaven.

I&#8217;ll be back next week, and I hope this thing keeps going. It&#8217;s terrific. Sometimes I am very glad to live in a city large enough to support something like this.
