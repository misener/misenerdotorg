> All the heavy hitters are coming out this week on Go. Â Hawksley Workman rocks the Go atmosphere with brand new tunes. Heather Mallick drops by, along with CBC&#8217;s Resident Cheapskate, &#8220;Discount&#8221; Dan Misener. Â And Grooveshinny rises once more out of the dungeon. Go &#8211; You paid for the whole seat, but you&#8217;re only going to need the edge!!! Â  Saturday at 10 a.m. (10:30 NT) on CBC Radio One.
