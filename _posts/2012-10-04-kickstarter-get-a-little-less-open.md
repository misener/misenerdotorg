Late last month, Kickstarter quietly removed its &#8220;Open Hardware&#8221; category, and added a broader &#8220;[Hardware](http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/hardware)&#8221; category.

At the same time, Kickstarter re-categorized every single &#8220;Open Hardware&#8221; project (past and present) into this new &#8220;Hardware&#8221; category.

I reached out to Kickstarter about this.

&#8220;This is not a policy change, just a name change,&#8221; a representative told me. &#8220;The hardware projects that were not open source had no subcategory, so we decided to simplify the name to house both.&#8221;

Still, I wondered what the open source community thought about Kickstarter&#8217;s removal of the dedicated &#8220;Open Hardware&#8221; category. So I got in touch with Erik Kettenburg, who recently raised more than $300,000 with his open-source [Digispark](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board) development board project. He graciously agreed to answer a few questions by email:

**Kickstarter has removed the &#8220;Open Hardware&#8221; category from its website, and replaced it with the more generic &#8220;Hardware&#8221; category. As someone who&#8217;s successfully crowdfunded an open hardware project on the site, what&#8217;s your reaction to this change?**

> I think the change to just &#8220;hardware&#8221; reflects the quasi-open source projects that were already being accepted to the category, I have no problem with not-completely-open-source hardware but I think they should instead make two categories because open source is more consistent with the culture of the site and should be emphasized as a result. I think the bigger issue at hand is the changes introduced by their blog post &#8220;[Kickstarter is not a store](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-not-a-store)&#8221; &#8211; it showed a fundamental lack of understanding of the open hardware industry and what both makers and customers need for a product to get off the ground. The Digispark would not have been the run away success it was if these new limitations (max of 1 item per reward specifically) had been in place, one Digispark is minimally useful and not really worth the shipping, but 3, 5, 25 are much more useful to a maker and in fact the Digispark was designed to be a building block that one could afford many of. On the production side, the demand for Digisparks allowed us to build an entire platform around it and, in fact, launch a new American family business from it, but it seems kickstarter is saying that they don&#8217;t want to promote that kind of success, at least not in hardware.

**How do you think this might impact the ability of open source hardware projects to receive attention and funding on the site?**

> I think it will remove one of the incentives for making hardware projects on Kickstarter open source, and that is a shame. I think the changes in Kickstarter rules will hurt funding of open hardware projects even more.

**When you launched your campaign, it was originally listed as an &#8220;Open Hardware&#8221; project. Now, in archived form on the site, it&#8217;s been recategorized into the more generic &#8220;Hardware&#8221; category. As a project creator, how do you feel about this after-the-fact recategorization of your project?**

> That doesn&#8217;t bother me, Kickstarter like any community is evolving and our campaign has move to [our website](http://digistump.com) where we are taking pre-orders, hosting a community forum, and will be launching a full web store in December. What remains to be seen is whether or not we&#8217;ll launch the Digispark Pro on Kickstarter, we think Kickstarter is a great platform for getting a project out there and making it possible, but the new rules make us wonder if hardware like ours is really welcome.
