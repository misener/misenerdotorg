Looks like the good folks over at Rogue Amoeba have released a new [beta](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/forum/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000649.html) of their excellent [Audio Hijack Pro](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/) application.

I use it to capture internet radio streams. This new version supports Griffin&#8217;s [RadioSHARK](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/index.php), so now I&#8217;ll be able to completely bypass the buggy Mac software that came with it.
