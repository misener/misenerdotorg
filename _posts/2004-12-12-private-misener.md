Two job shadows this past week â€“ one with Kevin Trudell at CFMX, and another with reporter Kevin Misener (no relation) at 680 News.

And more and more, Iâ€™ve been thinking about working in the private radio world. I came to Toronto last year with my sights set solely on the CBC, and Iâ€™m now thinking otherwise. Starting in the privates might not be such a bad idea. Every CBC exec Iâ€™ve talked to is looking for reporting skills and hard news experience. And though Iâ€™ve done several short doc pieces (morning show fare), Iâ€™ve never done any real &#8220;reporting.&#8221; And short of actually doing it, thereâ€™s no real way for me to get that type of experience.

So if the CBC wonâ€™t hire me without these skills, why not try to get a job at a place that might help me develop them? Like 680 or CFRB? From what Iâ€™ve seen, private radio deadlines would be great for someone like me. Having to churn out a report every 30 minutes is tough enough, but having to tell the same story several ways in under 40 seconds each time â€“ well, thatâ€™s enough to hone anybodyâ€™s chops.

A prof at Dalhousie once told me that the best way to get good at reading is to read, and the best way to get good at writing is to write. I think the same holds true for radio.

Iâ€™d love to do an internship at 680 (in addition to Metro Morning) â€“ it would be a great way to see the inside of a newsroom on a regular basis, and it wouldnâ€™t look too bad on a resume either. But, once again, because my program doesnâ€™t have a mandatory internship policy, I canâ€™t intern at 680 because of insurance issues.

However, I did do a couple of demo newscast reads at 680 with a woman named Anne Lavrih. She was wonderful, and apparently sheâ€™s going to play my demo for the higher-ups when theyâ€™re looking to staff the [new Rogers News/Talk station](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/2004/db2004-513.htm) in Halifax. Plus, Kevin mentioned to me that there might be spots available as an audio editor at 680. So all hope isnâ€™t lost.

Iâ€™m feeling like I need to focus my energies, but I donâ€™t know where. In many ways, itâ€™s the same question Iâ€™ve always had â€“ do I stay or do I go? And now on top of that, another question â€“ public or private?
