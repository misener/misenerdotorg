Or perhaps, equally appropriate, â€œThe squeaky wheel gets the grease.â€

Thatâ€™s certainly the way it feels right now. Nearly six months in the making, my internship at CBC Radio has finally been approved. I received this in my inbox yesterday afternoon, the result of my incessant pestering of Joan Melanson:

> I was in yesterday, and I have some good news &#8211; the approval for your internship at CBL has gone ahead.

Joan has been absolutely wonderful â€“ an advocate and a champion, navigating the turbulent waters of CBC bureaucracy on my behalf. After being told â€œmaybeâ€ for so long, then very recently â€œno,â€ she somehow managed to wrangle a â€œyesâ€ out of the powers that be. Kudos to her.
