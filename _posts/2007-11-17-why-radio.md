For some reason today, I was on Wikipedia, looking at the entry for [Radio documentary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_documentary). And I came across this rather lovely quote from Helmut Kopetzky:

> Staring red-eyed at the mirror in front of me, having spent another day and half of the night with my computer, I ask myself fundamental questions: Why radio? Why documentary? Answer: No other medium can provide me with more freedom of creation and investigation. It meets my urgent interest in reality and the desire for a &#8216;musical&#8217; expression. The material (_der Werkstoff_) is sound. And sound always surrounds us. And: I&#8217;m not so much interested in the description of stable situations, but in processes. Our medium is not space, but time; our stories are not glued to the ground, but have motion, life &#8230; That&#8217;s why!

  Kopetzky desire for &#8220;musical expression&#8221; reminded me of something I heard earlier this week. As I walked to work on Monday, I listened to <a href="http://www.radiolab.org">Radio Lab</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://feeds.wnyc.org/~r/radiolab/~3/182260937/09">Making Radio Lab</a> podcast, which draws heavily on their excellent <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2006/04/21">Musical Language</a> episode.Â  In it,

  If you&#8217;re a fan of the show, or at all interested in making radio, this is <strong>required listening</strong>.
