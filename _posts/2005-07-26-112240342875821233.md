From [last Friday&#8217;s](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&aid=85841) [Romenesko](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45) newsletter, comes a link to Eric Zorn&#8217;s _[Put your feet up, there&#8217;s more to flip-flop story](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ericzorn/chi-0507210046jul21,1,5590131.column?coll=chi-news-col)_:

> A lot of news, both serious and silly, starts this way&#8211;small observations or nagging questions that someone can&#8217;t shake and finally pursues, often after crashing through the barrier of doubt that anyone else cares.
