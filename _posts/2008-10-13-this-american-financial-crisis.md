[Kottke chimes in](http://www.kottke.org/08/10/this-american-life-on-the-financial-crisis) on [This American Life](http://www.thislife.org/)&#8216;s two excellent programs on the American financial system:

> This radio program made the rounds last week, but I finally got caught up this weekend so I&#8217;ll add my voice to the chorus urging you to listen to This American Life&#8217;s episode on the financial crisis, [Another Frightening Show About the Economy](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=365). Paired with [The Giant Pool of Money](http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355) from back in May, this is an excellent overview of what&#8217;s going on in the financial markets right now. The hosts of the two shows are also doing a daily blog/podcast thing at [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/) In addition, the [last half of this week&#8217;s TAL](http://thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=366) concerns the political angle of the financial mess. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to listen yet, but check it out if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.

I don&#8217;t have much to add to this beyond my own endorsement of these two programs, and also (because both shows have slipped into TAL&#8217;s archives) two [direct download links](http://misener.org/archives/364) to the MP3s:
