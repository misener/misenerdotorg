[<img src="http://www.m-audio.com/images/en/callouts/big/MicroTrack-hero.jpg" border="0" alt="" />](http://www.m-audio.com/images/en/callouts/big/MicroTrack-hero.jpg)I was excited when CDM [first reported](http://createdigitalmusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=663&Itemid=44) on M-Audio&#8217;s FlashTracker/MicroTrack recording unit.

Now it looks like this little unit is [official](http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/MicroTrack-main.html). A pro-quality digital recorder with headphone monitoring, USB transfers, and phantom power? For 500 dollars? Not too shabby. Unlike the Edirol R-1 I&#8217;ve been coveting, it doesn&#8217;t have built-in mics. And hopefully unlike the Edirol R-1, it won&#8217;t be perpetually on backorder.
