Recently, I bought and set up [DanMisener.com](http://www.danmisener.com), and ported over [Dan Misener likes the radio](http://danmisener.blogspot.com), my old blog about the radio. I did this in part because I found the old site to be a little constraining. Often I found myself wanting to write about things that have nothing at all to do with the radio. The sorts of things that don&#8217;t really belong on a &#8220;radio blog.&#8221; I was inspired by blogs like Joe Mahoney&#8217;s [assortednonsense.com](http://www.assortednonsense.com) and Pete Rukavina&#8217;s [ruk.ca](http://www.ruk.ca). These guys take a holistic approach, writing about anything and everything.

I like that.

So, from this point forward, this site will not longer be _Dan Misener likes the radio_. It will be simply Dan Misener dot com, and it will be about me. It will be my personal site. If you&#8217;re interested in me, Dan Misener (and honestly, who isn&#8217;t?) then please, continue to check it out.

&#8220;But wait!&#8221; you say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care about you, Dan Misener. I only come to your site to find out about neat gadgets and the status of the CBC&#8217;s mailmobile.&#8221;

Well, don&#8217;t fear. I still like the radio.

And I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Tod Maffin has asked me to help edit his [I Love Radio.org](http://www.iloveradio.org) site. I&#8217;m pleased as punch, and honoured to be asked.

So if you&#8217;re looking for stuff about me, stay right where you are. If you want to read about my thoughts on public radio, head on over to [I Love Radio.org](http://www.iloveradio.org).

Either way, thanks for reading. I appreciate it.
