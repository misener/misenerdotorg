Scanning through the iTunes podcast directory today, I came across something called [The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos Video Podcast](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=215119383&s=143455).

Now, iTunes doesn&#8217;t easily let you see the feed information for podcasts listed in its directory, but if you ping a feed (using its ID from the Music Store URL) like this:

<https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/pingPodcast?id=215119383>

You get:

> Podcast Ping Received
  
> Podcast Feed URL: <http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/rss/itunes_video.xml>
  
> Podcast ID: 215119383

Thanks, iTunes.

I haven&#8217;t seen this published anywhere (<strike>not even on The Hour&#8217;s site</strike>), but it&#8217;s listed in iTunes, and discoverable by mere mortals.

**Update:** Seems like all that sleuthing may have been in vain. CBCer Paul points to [a post on The Hour&#8217;s blog](http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/blog/2007/02/the_hours_launched_a_podcast.html) that announces this podcast dated February 15th. Also, there&#8217;s an [audio podcast feed](http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/rss/itunes_audio.xml) too.
