Thanks to built-in GPS and compass sensors, many modern smartphones have a very good sense of where they are in the physical world. And when connected to a service like Google Maps, it&#8217;s easy to get directions to almost anywhere.

But sometimes, isn&#8217;t GPS precision just a little too perfect?

Sometimes, don&#8217;t you wish your phone would give you only a _vague_ sense of where your destination is?

Introducing **ThatAway**, the first mobile navigation app that&#8217;s only marginally better than asking a Magic 8 Ball for directions.

Tell ThatAway what you&#8217;re looking for, and it displays a single arrow indicating the general direction of your destination. Nothing more. Nothing less. Forget maps, turn-by-turn directions, and accurate positioning. Just a single vector, pointing in (maybe) the right direction.

Under the hood, ThatAway uses your iPhone&#8217;s GPS and compass to accurately calculate your position and orientation. Then, it uses our patented Navigation Obfuscation Processing Engine (NOPE) technology to &#8220;sorta get that wrong.&#8221; ThatAway hooks into the powerful [Google Places API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/) to identify your intended destination. Then, every fifth time you use the app, it &#8220;picks wrong.&#8221;

If you&#8217;re looking a mobile navigation app that&#8217;s more like asking a drunk tourist for directions, try ThatAway.

**ThatAway**: Pointing you in the right direction. Sort of.
