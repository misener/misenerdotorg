I like the underlying tension of [my new iPhone wallpaper](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmisener/3202362689/). Steve Jobs&#8217;s smooth, shiny slider beckons me to head right, to unlock the phone and start fiddling around on the internet. But at the same time, crudely painted Bain Avenue graffiti suggests I should put the phone back in my pocket and continue to live in the real world.
