Good news in my inbox yesterday. My former podcast-labelmate Cathi Bond (of [The Sniffer](http://www.foursevens.com/thesniffer/) fame) has launched the second season of her Prosecast for HarperCollins Canada. The first edition features an interview with Vikram Chandra ([NYT review of his novel &#8220;Sacred Games&#8221;](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/books/review/Gray.t.html?bl&ex=1168491600&en=b3338e2d9b549324&ei=5087%0A)).

Congratulations Cathi, and best of luck with the new season.
