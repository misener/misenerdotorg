Dave Brodbeck [interviewed me](http://www.thunderbirdsix.org/episodes/t6_episode34.mp3) over Skype tonight. We talked about the podcast, the band, and the miracle of Craigslist.

Dave is one hell of a cool guy. We met at Podcasters Across Borders a couple of weeks back. Since meeting, I&#8217;ve been amazed to discover that he does three (!) podcasts: [Broca&#8217;s Area](http://www.brocasarea.ca/), [Thunderbird Six](http://www.thunderbirdsix.org/), plus a feed of his [psych lectures](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dave_psych) at Algoma University.

The interview was really a lot of fun. I&#8217;m flattered to have been asked. Thanks, Dave.
