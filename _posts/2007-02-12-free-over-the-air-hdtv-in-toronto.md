On the [front page of Digg](http://digg.com/gadgets/TV_Rabbit_Ears_Are_Back_In_High_Def) today, a link to [Prick Up Your Rabbit Ears](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17080800/site/newsweek/). It&#8217;s an article from Newsweek about over-the-air HDTV.

> When cable TV arrived in the &#8217;70s, rabbit ears seemed destined to go the way of the polyester pantsuit. So, too, the clunky outdoor antenna, a rooftop fixture that once upon a time signaled the rise of television in American life. But a funny thing happened on the way to the analog dust heap: it turns out that a new generation of rabbit ears and antennas can receive high-definition television broadcasts. And it&#8217;s free.

I&#8217;ve been picking up over-the-air (or OTA) HDTV for several months now, and I love it. Here in Toronto, with an [EyeTV Hybrid](http://elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetvhybridna) and a cheap RCA antenna (stolen from Jenna), I can pick up these channels in HD:

  1. CBC English
  2. CBC French
  3. CityTV
  4. CTV
  5. SunTV

If I had a better antenna, I could pick up additional channels from across the lake in Buffalo. The picture looks great on my 24-inch iMac, and I don&#8217;t miss having a dedicated TV set at all. The EyeTV software is excellent, and it records direct dumps of the HD signal. The built-in electronic program guide doesn&#8217;t work for Canadian channels (it relies on TitanTV data), but Guillaume Boudreau developed an excellent free workaround called [EyeTV EPG Proxy](http://eep.pommepause.com/).

Once you have the gear, OTA HDTV is free, looks great, and is perfect for someone like me who doesn&#8217;t watch a whole lot of television.

Here are some Toronto-related OTA HDTV resources I found helpful when getting started:

  * [Toronto & Buffalo area HDTV Channel Map](http://www.remotecentral.com/hdtv/)
  * [Toronto, Ontario HDTV forum on AVS forums](http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=465187)
  * [ON &#8211; City of Toronto Metro Area &#8211; OTA on Digital Home forums](http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/showthread.php?t=42391)
