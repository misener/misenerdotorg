Last August, Jenna and I drove to Somerset Mall in Troy, Michigan to pick up an iPhone. A few weeks later, it was [unlocked](http://misener.org/archives/293). Since then, it&#8217;s been an amazing phone/iPod/camera/web device. I really love  carrying just one device.

But there&#8217;s a problem: Mobile data rates in Canada are atrociously high. Unlimited plans (like the one that comes with the iPhone in the US) just don&#8217;t exist north of the border. For many, this limits internet connectivity to WiFi hotspots, which sadly, aren&#8217;t everywhere, and aren&#8217;t always free. This seriously affects the &#8220;always-connected&#8221; appeal of the iPhone.

But&#8230;

If you&#8217;re with [Fido](http://fido.ca), and you sign up for the $18 [Value Pack](http://www.fido.ca/portal/en/packages/value_packs.shtml), 12 megabytes of data are included per month. &#8220;Hah!&#8221; you say, &#8220;That&#8217;s a paltry amount of data.&#8221;

Yes, it is. But here&#8217;s the thing: if you sign up for the Value Pack, you get **unlimited data during the first four months.** Not 12 megabytes. Unlimited.

I signed up a few weeks ago on a monthly package (no contract) and it&#8217;s working great. I&#8217;ve called back several times to confirm that I am indeed signed up for unlimited browsing, and the answer has always been yes.

This is covered quite thoroughly on [HowardForums](http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?t=1255306&highlight=unlimited).  YMMV, but if you have an iPhone in Canada, and want a data plan, this is the way to go (for a few months, anyway).
