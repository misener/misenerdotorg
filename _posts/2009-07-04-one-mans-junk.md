There&#8217;s a [famous story](http://ebay.about.com/od/ebaylifestyle/a/el_history.htm) about the first item sold on eBay:

> [T]he site began with the listing of a single broken laser pointer. Though Pierre [Omidyar, eBay&#8217;s founder] had intended the listing to be a test more than a serious offer to sell at auction, he was shocked when the item sold for $14.83. Pierre knew that he&#8217;d created something big as soon as he contacted the winning bidder to ask if he understood that the pointer was broken.
> 
> &#8220;I&#8217;m a collector of broken laser pointers,&#8221; came the reply.

I had a similar experience yesterday. Going through the closet, I found some old electronics I wanted to get rid of, including a broken T-Mobile Dash that I&#8217;d nearly forgotten about. So I posted it on Craiglist:

> For sale: one piece of crap T-Mobile Dash (aka HTC Excalibur).
> 
> I hate this phone. It doesn&#8217;t work well at all. It reboots randomly. The camera doesn&#8217;t work. It drops calls. It&#8217;s awful.

A few hours later, a message in my inbox:

> I shall remove that peice [sic] of junk from your hands&#8230;

Turns out someone needed parts for their own broken Dash. We met up a few hours later. The buyer got the phone, I got some cash, and nothing ended up in the landfill.

Thanks Internet.
