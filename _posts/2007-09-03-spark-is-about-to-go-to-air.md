For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on a new radio show for the CBC. It&#8217;s called [Spark](http://www.cbc.ca/spark), it&#8217;s about technology and trendwatching, and the first episode airs this Wednesday morning at 11:30. A repeat broadcast airs Saturday afternoon at 4:00, and the [podcast](http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/index.html?newsandcurrent#spark) (which, thrillingly, is exactly the same as the broadcast version) should be available starting early Wednesday morning.

I really hope you can listen.
