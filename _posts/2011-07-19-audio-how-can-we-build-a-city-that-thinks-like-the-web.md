Back in June, I moderated a panel at the 2011 Subtle Technologies Festival. It was called [How can we build a city that thinks like the web?](http://www.subtletechnologies.com/862), and included Cory Doctorow (Boing Boing), Mark Surman (Mozilla) and Sara Diamond (OCAD University).

This week, on my [CBC tech podcast](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/misener-on-tech-from-cbc-radio/id438669328), I&#8217;m really pleased to be able to play the full (1 hour+) panel: [audio:http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/podcasts/misenerontech\_20110719\_46301.mp3]
