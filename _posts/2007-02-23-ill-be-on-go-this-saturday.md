I&#8217;m on the radio this weekend, joining [Go](http://www.cbc.ca/go) for their [Canada Reads](http://www.cbc.ca/canadareads) spoof called &#8220;Canada Skims Magazines.&#8221;

I&#8217;ll be on a panel with Scott Thompson, Jean Yoon, and Olivia Chow, pitching [Lou Lou](http://www.louloumagazine.com/) as the magazine every Canadian should be skimming.

Should be fun.

Saturday morning at 10 on CBC Radio One or [listen online](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/).
