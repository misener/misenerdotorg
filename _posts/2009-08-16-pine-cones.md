We&#8217;ve been to Ed&#8217;s Real Scoop in Leslieville several times this summer, and I can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t notice this visual gag sooner:

According to [this week&#8217;s Now](http://www.nowtoronto.com/food/story.cfm?content=170841), Ed&#8217;s is one of Toronto&#8217;s top ten ice cream shops. Personally, I prefer the gelato.
