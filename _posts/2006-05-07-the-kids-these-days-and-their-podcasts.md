Tristan and I have started another video podcast. It&#8217;s called [Canadian Heritage Vignettes](http://feeds.feedburner.com/canadianheritagevignettes/). It is short, subtitled, shot entirely with my digital camera, and will probably be updated infuriatingly infrequently.

You might also want to check out the newest [Collective Production](http://www.collectiveproductions.com). It&#8217;s called [The Podcast of My Discontent](http://podcastofmydiscontent.blogspot.com/), and it features (probably) more Tristan Homer than you could possibly ever want. It&#8217;s cleverly edited.
