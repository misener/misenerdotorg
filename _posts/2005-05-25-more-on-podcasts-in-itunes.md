I bought my first song from the iTunes Music Store a few weeks ago, and hopefully [podcasts in iTunes 4.9](http://www.macminute.com/2005/05/23/itunes-podcast/) will be just as simple.

Imagine it. No third-party applications. No muss. No fuss. If Apple can make podcasts dead simple, this will be big. Really big.

And now, some major commercial content providers are jumping on board. From [MacMinute](http://www.macminute.com/2005/05/25/nbc-abc-podcasts/):

> Hot on the heals [sic] of Apple CEO Steve Jobs announcement Monday that the company&#8217;s next version of iTunes (due within 60 days) will support and help organize podcasts, NBC News and ABC news have said they will be offering podcasts to listeners, reports Forbes. ABC is offers new and rerun material now, and NBC expects to have podcasts available next month. &#8220;The allure of such TV-to-radio news transmogrification is still up for debate,&#8221; notes the story. &#8220;While recidivistic &#8216;news junkies&#8217; may prize any portable info delivery system, some skeptics say it&#8217;s as thrilling as watching TV with your eyes closed.&#8221;
