Details are slim, but on Monday [the Wall Street Journal reported](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904265504576565040210224696.html) that Amazon.com is in talks with book publishers &#8220;about launching a Netflix Inc.-like service for digital books, in which customers would pay an annual fee to access a library of content.&#8221; The Amazon service could offer an all-you-can-read model, or a rate-limited model that includes a certain number of books per month.

If it&#8217;s true, and if such a service comes to be, it&#8217;ll be the latest in a growing trend towards what Ron J. Williams calls the &#8220;[access economy](http://blog.snapgoods.com/2010/07/23/hello-world/)&#8220;, which emphasizes access to products and services over ownership.

The idea of paying a flat fee for all-you-can-eat media is nothing new. Just look at the rapid growth of Netflix, which gained almost [one million subscribers during its first 10 months in Canada](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/0x0x485533/e230e7dc-cb82-4175-b944-d9ddc3c0960c/July%20Investor%20Letter%201130am.pdf). Or look at the growing geographic footprint and popularity of subscription-based music services like Spotify and Rdio. Given our increasing appetite for e-books (which outsold both paperbacks and hardcovers for the first time this past February), the written word is a logical next step in the march towards a subscription-based post-scarcity media landscape.

If Amazon does launch a digital book rental service, it won&#8217;t be the first.[Booksfree.com](http://booksfree.com/) has been around for more than a decade, and ships physical books to subscribers through the mail. Or there&#8217;s [24symbols](http://www.24symbols.com/), which sells premium e-book subscriptions that can be read online or via a mobile application. In the education space, five of the largest academic publishers in North America have teamed up to create an e-textbook rental service called [CourseSmart](http://www.coursesmart.com/).

But according to Wired.com staff writer and book-futurist Tim Carmody, Amazon is uniquely positioned in this space: &#8220;They&#8217;ve got the credit card accounts. They&#8217;ve got the customers. They&#8217;ve got the devices. If anyone is in a position to do it, and to do it well, Amazon would be the one to do it.&#8221;

A big factor here is Amazon&#8217;s existing business selling its Kindle e-reader. In fact, reports of a possible Amazon book subscription service dovetail nicely with rumours about the next-generation Kindle, which[TechCrunch&#8217;s MG Siegler reports](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/amazon-kindle-tablet/) will be a $250 7-inch touchscreen tablet running a highly customized version of Google&#8217;s Android operating system. The device is also reported to have tight integration with Amazon&#8217;s existing App Store and video and music streaming services.

It&#8217;s worth noting that with its video streaming service, Amazon has already dipped its toe into the world of content subscriptions. Earlier this year, it launched [Amazon Instant Video](http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Video/b?ie=UTF8&node=2858778011), a U.S.-only Netflix competitor that streams movies and TV shows.

## Buy or borrow

It&#8217;s also worth noting that there&#8217;s another very prominent all-you-can-read book and e-book service out there, and I&#8217;m already a member (you probably are, too). It&#8217;s called &#8220;the library.&#8221;

Many Canadian libraries offer e-books, and [though they may self-destruct](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/03/08/f-vp-misener-ebooks.html), they cost nothing to borrow. Over at [The Guardian&#8217;sBooks Blog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/sep/12/amazon-book-rental-ebook), Sarah Crown wonders what Amazon&#8217;s possible e-book rental service could mean for libraries: &#8220;If you can &#8216;borrow&#8217; the ebook instantly from your living room, why would you bother schlepping into town to pick it up in person? It&#8217;s a super-smart move on the part of [Amazon], but the real-world fallout could be extensive.&#8221;

I&#8217;m not so sure about that. Libraries are much more than publicly-funded e-book repositories. But even if that&#8217;s all they were, your local public library could have a better selection of e-book titles than an Amazon service at launch, which would likely focus on older, back-catalogue titles.

It&#8217;ll all depend on the deals Amazon can (or can&#8217;t) make with publishers.

According to the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s report, &#8220;Amazon would offer book publishers a substantial fee for participating in the program.&#8221; Indeed, Amazon&#8217;s existing relationships with publishers could work to its advantage when setting up this kind of service.

But publishers can be resistant to change, and a mass-market subscription model would represent a very big change in the way books get to consumers. Tim Carmody says publishers are skeptical: &#8220;They have no idea how to price access to a service like this. And also because Amazon already exerts so much power over the publishing industry, between print books and e-books, that all of the publishers are really wary of making themselves even more entangled than they already are with Amazon.&#8221;

For me, the most interesting part of such a book service is the effect it could have on the way we read.

In my own personal experience, flat-fee digital subscription options tend to lubricate the wheels of media consumption. As a paid subscriber to Rdio, I listen to way more new music than I would if I had to pay per song or album. After my parents and in-laws signed up for Netflix, both households reported watching more movies than with the a-la-carte options of the video store or their cable companies&#8217; video-on-demand services.

Part of me wonders if an all-you-can-read book rental subscription would encourage me to read more, or try out new kinds of books I mightn&#8217;t otherwise.
