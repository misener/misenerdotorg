Headed to Windsor tomorrow for my pal Tom&#8217;s [Big Walk](http://tomlucier.wordpress.com/2008/10/11/big-walk/), which got some great coverage in [The Star](http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=a977e94e-6b0f-48e3-87d2-359a0d96dc03) today.

Basically, we&#8217;re going to walk across Windsor, Ontario for 16 hours.

Looking forward to some sore feet!
