<img align="right" alt="Editor's Choice logo" title="Editor's Choice logo" src="http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/images/promo-editorschoice-sm.jpg" />[Angela Misri](http://karmic-angel.blogspot.com/), who is in charge of CBC Radio podcasts, is away for a few weeks. So I&#8217;m filling in for her. Included in my daily duties is something called [Editor&#8217;s Choice](http://www.cbc.ca/editorschoice/), which is a daily podcast that features a particularly good bit plucked from CBC Radio&#8217;s broadcast day.

If you feel like listening, visit the website and grab an MP3 or subscribe to the [feed](http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/editorschoice.xml). And if you&#8217;re a regular listener and miss Angela&#8217;s voice, don&#8217;t worry. You only have to put up with me for two weeks.
