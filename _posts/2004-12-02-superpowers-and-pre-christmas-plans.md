Finally got my Sean Ward piece in the can this week. I showed up at the CBC this Tuesday, and with the help of Nick Davis, whittled my 6:10 mix down to something like 4:40. Nick is the third CBC producer Iâ€™ve worked with, and I always find it helpful to work with someone whoâ€™s not as attached to my material as I am. To paraphrase [Trevor Ross](http://www.dal.ca/~englwww/faculty/ross.htm), Nick has a keen ear and sharp pair of scissors.

Sean is having a release party for his new book this Sunday. And though itâ€™s a shame the piece wonâ€™t air before then, at least thereâ€™s a nice timely trigger for it to be played. Tonight I listened to the Transom front page story [Family Sentence](http://transom.org/shows/2004/200411.familysentence.html) by Jeanne Cornillot, which feature a character who, like Sean, fancies himself a superhero. This made me think of one of my favourite This American Life episodes, [Superpowers](http://www.thislife.org/pages/descriptions/01/178.html), which features the great first act Invisible Man vs. Hawkman.

Tomorrow is my last day of classes, but Iâ€™m stuck here in Toronto until the 15th, when I write my Case Studies in Communications exam. Iâ€™ve been compiling a list of radio-related things to do in the meantime. It includes:

  1. Finally finishing up my polka story. Iâ€™ve been pursuing a woman named Jennifer Grant at the [Textile Museum of Canada](http://www.museumfortextiles.on.ca/). I think there are four messages on her voicemail from me.
  2. Starting on a â€œjust for funâ€ Christmas-themed piece about [the Bay](http://www.hbc.com/) and its holiday slogan: â€œThe Official Store of Christmas.â€ How do you get to be the official store of Christmas? I contacted the Bay PR yesterday. The woman there said sheâ€™ll do some research and get back to me. Something tells me Iâ€™ll have to hound her. Iâ€™d love to get a statement from somebody at the Bay explaining how exactly you get accredited as the official store of Christmas. Also, Iâ€™d like to get some streeters â€“ people checking out the famous downtown Bay (formerly Simpsonâ€™s) store windows.
  3. Job shadows. Iâ€™ve got one set up for Classical 96.3 for this coming Tuesday with [Kevin Trudell](http://classical963.com/oa_personalities.php), and Iâ€™ve been talking with Anne Lavrih at [680](http://680news.com/) about shadowing Kevin Misener.
  4. Putting together a killer newscast for my demo reel. Dwight Smith has agreed to listen to whatever I come up with and critique it.

Should keep me busy.
