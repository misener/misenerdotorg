A message from Mara in my inbox tonight:

> I&#8217;m very interested in attending the Grownups Read event on Monday, but the start time isn&#8217;t mentioned on the website. It would probably help if I knew when to show up.

I&#8217;ve had a couple of very valid questions like this over the past little while, so here&#8217;s a little FAQ about the next reading event, which happens at the [Gladstone Hotel Ballroom](http://www.gladstonehotel.com/ballroom.htm) this Monday, March 10, 2008.

**1. When should I show up?**

Doors open at 8:00. We&#8217;ll get started as soon as possible after that.

**2. Where do I get tickets?**

You don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s free. Just show up before we run out of space.

**3. Can I bring something to read?**

Yes, please. This is an open-mic event, and it only works when people actually bring things to read in front of other. Too many spectators makes for a short and boring night. Sign-up is on a first-come, first-served basis, but I&#8217;d really appreciate an [email](http://misener.org/contact) if you plan on bringing something, just so I can gauge the numbers.

**4. What does &#8220;kid&#8221; mean?**

Kid = whatever you consider kid to mean. One of the best things about GRTTWaK is the wide variety of things people bring to read. We&#8217;ve had stuff from early elementary school all the way up to college age writing. Bring whatever you want.

**5. How long should my piece be?**

Short. See the third [rule](http://read.danmisener.com/?page_id=12) of GRTTWaK:

  1. You have to be the one who wrote it, as a kid
  2. You have to be the one who reads it, as an adult
  3. It has to be short (<5 minutes-ish)

That should cover most of the frequently asked questions. If you have another one, [email me](http://misener.org/contact). Hope to see you out on Monday night. Here&#8217;s the official blurb:

> **GROWNUPS READ THINGS THEY WROTE AS KIDS** is an open-mic evening of adults reading things they wrote as children &#8212; poems, book reports, and diary entries. Monday, March 10 at 8:00pm. Free. The Gladstone Hotel Ballroom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://read.danmisener.com/" target="_blank">http://read.danmisener.com</a></span>
