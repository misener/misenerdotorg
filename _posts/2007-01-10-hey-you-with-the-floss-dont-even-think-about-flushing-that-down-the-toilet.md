A few (maybe five) dentist appointments ago, I resolved to floss my teeth every single day. The first month was really tough, but once I got into the routine, it stuck.

For as long as I&#8217;ve been flossing regularly, I&#8217;ve been disposing of my dental floss in the toilet. I mean, it makes sense: I floss in the bathroom, and the toilet is right there, waiting to receive my stringy offering. I also believe at one time (though I may be wrong about this), I actually wrote a little song about floss in the toilet.

Well, according to an [article](http://www.thestar.com/article/169538) Jenna sent me today, I should not dispose of my floss in this manner. It seems that floss,

> especially newer brands, is shred-resistant, and when strands end up in waste-water, they bind with other waste, creating what one Toronto Water supervisor called a &#8220;snowball effect.&#8221;
> 
> Clumps are formed â€“ one found last week was about the size of a softball â€“ and they gum up impellers, which are part of the pumps in the city&#8217;s sanitary pumping stations.

The size of a softball? That&#8217;s both awesome and disgusting. The article goes on to explain that this problem is particularly common in downtown Toronto, and advises residents to place floss in their waste bins instead.

I&#8217;ll try to do that. Or maybe I&#8217;ll just start my own clump of used floss, and hope it grows to the size of a basketball. Is there a Guiness World Record for that?
