I spent the past week chase producing for CBC national radio Syndication.

It was a fun job because of the variety of stuff I got to do. I set up live interviews for local/regional shows across Canada about pirates, quick fix diets/exercise/surgery, and war correspondents. I also did a couple of interviews myself, sliced my voice out of them, and sent them down the pipe. I got to talk to Canadians and Jordanians about Wednesday&#8217;s hotel bombings and demonstrations, and to the author of a new handbook about visiting elderly relatives. So, a mixed bag.

Syndication is a fun unit. The people I worked with are nice, and funny, and smart. The experience was good for me. If Fight Club is the reason to &#8220;cut your hair short and trim your fingernails,&#8221; Syndication is the reason to pay attention to national and international news.

Before this week, I&#8217;d only been on the receiving end of syndicated content. Now I think I have a better appreciation of where this stuff comes from, and what its role in local/regional programming is supposed to be.
