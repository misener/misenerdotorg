On Monday night, Tristan came over to work on the soon-to-be-shipped Jim Dupree: Enthusiast <a target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog" href="http://www.foursevens.com/jimdupree/2006/07/23/dvd-set-update/">box set</a> (theyâ€™re looking great, by the way, and will be in your hands soon). While he was over, he told me about his newest blog: <a target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog" href="http://tristanhomer.blogspot.com/">Tristan presents: The Truth</a>.

Now, if thereâ€™s one thing Tristan Homer likes to do, itâ€™s to start web-based projects, then delete them soon after (for fear that a future employer will discover them).

<a target="_blank" class="blines3" title="Link outside of this blog" href="http://tristanhomer.blogspot.com/">Tristan presents: The Truth</a> celebrates its first month online tomorrow. Join me in congratulating Tristan for keeping his finger off the delete key.

That is, if itâ€™s still there tomorrow.
