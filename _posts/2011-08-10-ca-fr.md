Here&#8217;s the news: Jenna and I are packing up, leaving Toronto, and moving to France. For an entire year. Starting in January 2012.

If you&#8217;re family or a close friend, this is probably not news. We&#8217;ve been planning this for almost three years, and though we haven&#8217;t kept it a secret, we also haven&#8217;t widely publicized the fact that we&#8217;re moving. Until now.

With less than five months to go, I suspect I&#8217;ll be writing more about our plans here on this blog, and I bet Jenna will do the same over at [ahbon.ca](http://ahbon.ca)

## Why are you doing this?

Because we can. We&#8217;re child-less, mortgage-less, car-less, and for the most part, responsibility-less. Which won&#8217;t always be the case. If there was ever a time in our lives to pick up and skip town, it&#8217;s now.

I&#8217;ve lived in Toronto for seven years now, and Jenna&#8217;s been here for more than a decade. Part of the goal is to escape the scale of a city like Toronto, and simply to live somewhere else for a change. Right now, the plan is to move to [Lyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon), about two hours (by train) southeast of Paris.

## How are you doing this?

France and Canada have this thing called the [France-Canada youth exchange agreement](http://www.ambafrance-ca.org/spip.php?article1950). We&#8217;re eligible for 12-month &#8220;Working Holiday&#8221; visas (2E), which are for &#8220;Canadians wishing to travel to France for touristic and cultural purposes, all the while being authorized to work for financial sustenance.&#8221;

Neat, huh? It&#8217;s great being a &#8220;youth.&#8221;

## So, why France? Why Lyon?

First off, we&#8217;re moving to France to learn French. Right now, my French isn&#8217;t great, but it&#8217;s halfway passable. I can order food and get directions, but I&#8217;m can&#8217;t have deep conversations about philosophy and literature. Jenna&#8217;s French is much better than mine, but we could both stand to improve. We figure immersion will help, and where better to immerse ourselves?

We chose Lyon for a few reasons. First, because it&#8217;s not Paris, and thus, we can afford to live there. It&#8217;s the third largest city in France, and feels not too big, and not too small. Plus, it&#8217;s la capitale gastronomique fran√ßaise, so chances are we&#8217;ll eat well.

Lyon is decently well-connected to other parts of Europe by rail and air, and we&#8217;re really hoping it&#8217;ll be a good home base for a bit of travel.

## What about your jobs?

One of the perks of a staff job at the CBC is the [Deferred Salary Leave Plan](http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/docs/policies/hr/leave.shtml) (schoolteachers have something similar, which they call &#8220;4 over 5&#8221;). Essentially, I&#8217;ll be on an unpaid leave of absence for one year, after which I come right back to the job I left. Appropriately enough, 2012 will be my seventh year with the CBC, so I&#8217;m calling this &#8220;roll your own sabbatical.&#8221;

As for Jenna, she&#8217;ll be leaving her plum position at the [HDI](http://www.historica-dominion.ca/en/). She&#8217;s done a lot there over the past few years, and it&#8217;ll be tough for her to leave. But with so many successes under her belt ([2500+ WWII veteran interviews!](http://www.historica-dominion.ca/en/news/14007_korean-and-second-world-war-veterans-share-their-stories-with-the-memory-project)) and fluent bilingualism by the time we return to Canada, she&#8217;ll be unstoppable.

While we&#8217;re in France, we&#8217;ll probably both do a little bit of work. Financially, we won&#8217;t have to worry too much about housing and food (we&#8217;ve been squirrelling cash away for a few years now), but the degree to which we&#8217;re able to travel will depend on how much part-time or freelance work we&#8217;re able to pick up.

Personally, I&#8217;m also planning to spend part of the year doing some serious self-directed study [in the service of becoming a programmer-journalist](http://misener.org/archives/606).

## What about your super-awesome apartment in Toronto that you really love and would hate to give up?

Um, yeah, we&#8217;re working on that.

Know anyone who wants to sublet a super-awesome apartment in downtown Toronto for 12 months starting in January 2012?

## Wait a second, is this really a good idea?

We really think so. A few weeks ago, we did a short scouting trip to Lyon, and loved it. We met so many nice, friendly, helpful people, and the city itself is beautiful.

I&#8217;m sure there will be challenges, but that&#8217;s part of the point. For example, as we work through the visa application process, I&#8217;m getting a small taste of French bureaucracy&#8217;s love of paperwork. The language will be tricky, I&#8217;m sure (especially for me). Getting set up with an apartment and bank account may be tricky. But if it means we can live abroad for a year, expand our horizons, and get some perspective, it&#8217;ll be worth it.

The past few years of my life have become very comfortable. The same city. The same apartment. The same job. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with comfortable, of course, but increasingly, I feel the need to shake things up. To do something that makes me feel uncomfortable. To get outside of the ordinary.

This is an opportunity to do exactly that, and I can&#8217;t wait.
