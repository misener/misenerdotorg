As Jessica mentions in [this comment](http://danmisener.blogspot.com/2005/06/thoughts-on-odeo.html#comments), the CKDU Pop Culture Collective&#8217;s [Popped Culture](http://www.poppedculture.ca) is now [podcasting](http://podcast.ckdu.ca/pc.xml). I listened to the first episode of the new season a few days ago, and it&#8217;s excellent. Almost enough to make me want to move to Halifax and join the collective.

A quick check of the [CKDU podcasting site](http://podcast.ckdu.ca) shows that Popped Culture joins [Let&#8217;s Get Baked](http://letsgetbaked.ckdu.ca)&#8216;s [podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/LetsGetBakedPodcast) and [What&#8217;s New Mitsou?](http://mitsou.ckdu.ca/)&#8216;s [podcast](http://mitsou.ckdu.ca/mitsou.xml), to bring CKDU&#8217;s podcast simulcast count up to 3. Way to go!
