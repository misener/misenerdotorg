Progress:

  * Only an hour of tape left to make notes on for the Sean Ward piece 
      * Got some halfway decent Silver Snail tape 
          * Heard back from Brian from the polka band. He thinks the idea is &#8220;a blast,&#8221; and I&#8217;m tentatively scheduled to sit in on a polka jam in early November 
              * Lost a Polka Dot Door contact; will have to find another
  
                  * Gary Gould&#8217;s CBC friend Joe Mahoney returned my email. Will call him tomorrow to arrange for a coffee meeting.</p> 
                      * I will be job shadowing CBL&#8217;s Geoff Ellwand sometime soon 
                          * I will be having coffee with Joe Cummings this coming Tuesday </ul> 
                            To do:
                            
                              * Contact someone from 680 re: job shadowing 
                                  * Start/finish this McGettigan paper 
                                      * Get my _Hey Jude_ MIDI assignment done </ul> 
                                        Exciting product accouncements:
                                        
                                          * XM Radio&#8217;s [MyFi](http://www.xmradio.com/myfi/): &#8220;wearable&#8221; satellite radio with HDD for recording 
                                              * Apple&#8217;s [iPod Photo](http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/): still no decent recording capabilities. Plus, [Canadian ITMS](http://www.macminute.com/2004/10/26/euitms/) by early November. </ul>
