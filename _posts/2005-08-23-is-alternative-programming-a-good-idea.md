I just finished listening to [CBC Unplugged from Studio Zero](http://cmgvancouver.org/). And I got to thinking about CBC workers generating &#8220;alternative programming&#8221; during the lockout. What does that really mean? And is it necessarily a good idea?

As far as I understand, the lockout has prompted two different programming strategies. There&#8217;s the &#8220;business as usual&#8221; camp, which thinks CBC reporters and newsreaders should continue doing what they do best: reporting and reading the news, covering the same stories they ordinarily would were they inside the building. I would put Toronto&#8217;s (as yet unheard) _World at Six_ replacement podcast and Calgary&#8217;s [_Eyepatch Radio_](http://www.brandonsun.com/story.php?story_id=1304) in this category.

There&#8217;s also the &#8220;lockout propaganda&#8221; school of programming &#8212; reporting on the lockout itself. This seems to be what Vancouver&#8217;s _CBC Unplugged_ is &#8212; &#8220;music, comedy, commentary, and the latest news in the labour dispute.&#8221; I would also include the various podcasts produced by CMG locals in this category.

What kind of message does this alternative programming send to the public? Advocates say it says, &#8220;We still care about public broadcasting. We care about telling Canadian stories. We want to work&#8230; we just can&#8217;t.&#8221;

On the other hand, critics say it undermines the Guild&#8217;s efforts, sending the message, &#8220;Hey look at us! We can still generate programming, even without _any_ CBC resources!&#8221; Some say that picketing &#8212; not working &#8212; is a much better alternative, and sends a more powerful message. As Curious Monkey says, &#8220;Why not just walk back into the building and do it right?&#8221;

By generating alternative programming, are we shooting ourselves in the foot? I&#8217;m not sure yet. Personally, I don&#8217;t think the &#8220;business as usual&#8221; programming is the answer. And frankly, I worry that few outside of the CMG care about &#8220;lockout propaganda&#8221; programming.

Thoughts?
