My friend Laura Peek is a very talented singer-songwriter. For a good long while now, she&#8217;s been talking me about a record she&#8217;s working on. And I&#8217;ve been waiting patiently since she first mentioned it.

Luckily, it seems that the wait will soon be over. According to her blog, the new CD will likely come out in April. What&#8217;s more, she&#8217;s posted three new songs from it on [her MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/laurapeek) page. And, she&#8217;s playing in Toronto on March 11th.

Go listen to Laura&#8217;s songs. They&#8217;re good.
