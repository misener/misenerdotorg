  When <a href="http://twitter.com/zuschlag">Jenna</a> and I got married, we wanted copies of some family photos to have on display at our wedding parties. So we scanned in a bunch of photos from our parents&#8217; originals, then printed out new copies and put them in frames. We still have the frames on our mantle.

A fews months ago, in the midst of a [digital backup frenzy](http://misener.org/archives/967), it struck me that if our apartment burned down, there&#8217;d be no need to try and save these framed pictures. We could just print out identical copies from the digital files (stored safely off-site). In an odd way, we have a digital backup of some very physical items.
