I&#8217;m back in Toronto. The picketing here runs 24/7.

Roommate Tristan and I arrived home late last night after a game of squash. We got in the door, and he asked what time it was. I joked, &#8220;I stopped caring about the time a few weeks ago.&#8221;

Then the the truth of it sank in. I&#8217;ve been here almost a week, and my alarm clock is still unplugged.
