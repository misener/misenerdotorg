Over the past little while, I&#8217;ve been reading and thinking a lot about a new type of media job: a hybrid position that some people are calling &#8220;programmer-journalist.&#8221; Witness, for example:

  * From PBS.org in 2007: [Meet the First Two Journalist- Programmers](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2007/12/meet-the-first-two-journalist--programmers005.html) about Brian Boyer and Ryan Mark, both winners of Knight News Challenge scholarships
  * From the Knight Foundation itself: [4th Programmer-Journalist Scholarship Winner Learns to &#8216;Think Like a Journalist&#8217;](http://www.knightpulse.org/node/41760) about another Knight scholarship winner, [Manya Gupta](http://www.knightpulse.org/node/41760)
  * [](http://www.knightpulse.org/node/41760)Mashable&#8217;s roundup of <a shape="rect" href="http://mashable.com/2009/12/11/programmer-journalists/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29&utm_content=Google+Reader">How Programmer/Journalists Are Changing the News</a>

Just this past week, [Jenny Carpenter](http://www.jennycarpenter.com/) sent me a link to a Guardian article: [Will journalists of the future need to know how to code?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/jan/15/digital-media-journalism-education) From it:

> Up until now, as a journalist you worked with information, researching facts and figures which then you passed on to the reader. However, in a digital world there are more platforms you can use to convey that information â€“ think of maps or mobile applications, augmented reality. And to be able to do that you will have know how to code.

Now, I&#8217;m no programmer. Not a real one, anyway. Sure, I know enough HTML and CSS to tweak WordPress themes. I know a tiny little bit of PHP. Through school, I worked summers at a [software company](http://dymaxion.ca/). And once upon a time, in the summer of 1998, I wrote a [reasonably popular piece of (now-useless) Windows shareware](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=abstractamation+mcatis&btnG=Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=) in Visual Basic.

But really, I&#8217;m no programmer. Though I intend to become one.

&#8212;

&#8220;Why?&#8221; you ask?

I work in public radio, a business that&#8217;s experiencing a renaissance through digital technology, especially podcasts. There are lots of exciting things happening in [places where the web meets the radio](http://cbc.ca/spark). Judging by the success of shows like [Radiolab](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/), and [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/), there&#8217;s an appetite for compelling stories told in new and interesting ways. A big part of that is happening online. For example, look at how [simple yet compelling the Globe and Mail&#8217;s interactive map of Haiti is](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/haiti/before-and-after-satellite-images/article1432785/).

Companies like the CBC (my employer) need people who can build this kind of stuff. They need storytellers with programming chops, and programmers with storytelling chops.

I want to be one of those people.

So then, starting today, I&#8217;m embarking on a course of self-directed study. It&#8217;s my intention to become a sort of programmer-journalist, and I plan to blog about what I find here in this space. First step: [learn Python](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide).

I&#8217;d love to hear any thoughts or suggestions about where I should take this. Comments are most welcome.
