Why, when I visit the [CBC Radio portal page](http://www.cbc.ca/radio) on Sunday evening, does it think that **CBC Radio Overnight** is playing in all time zones?

This is the second weekend I can remember CBC Radio Overnight supposedly playing all Sunday. Now, for the record, I _do_ think the new CBC Radio page is an improvement over the previous version. The &#8220;Find a Program&#8221; filter is pretty slick.

But why can&#8217;t the site reliably display correct program information?

I mean, over at [PublicRadioFan.com](http://www.publicradiofan.com), I can create a list of my favourite stations, and it displays not just what&#8217;s playing on them now, but also what&#8217;s coming up in the future. Hands-down, it&#8217;s a better source of program information than the CBC&#8217;s own site. And from what I can tell, PublicRadioFan is run by one guy, [Kevin A. Kelly](http://alum.mit.edu/www/kakelly), in his spare time.

Seriously. Come on.
