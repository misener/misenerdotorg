As a guy who loves the sound of small Ampeg amplifiers (I play through a B-100R), I&#8217;ve been curious to hear how the &#8220;cute&#8221; new [Ampeg Micro-VR](http://www.ampeg.com/products/classic/microvr/index.html) actually sounds. Now, thanks to The Swell Season and the Onion AV Club, I know:

That&#8217;s Joe Doyle (from The Frames) on bass.
