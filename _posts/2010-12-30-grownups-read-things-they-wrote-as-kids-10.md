[Four years ago](http://misener.org/archives/232), as a New Year&#8217;s resolution, I decided to host &#8220;an evening of drinks, laughs, and adults reading funny, sad, and/or embarrassing things they wrote as children.&#8221; That evening turned into a series called [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com).

And in about one month&#8217;s time, we&#8217;ll gather for the tenth installment, [GRTTWaK10](http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/2010/12/announcing-grttwak10-ten/).

If you&#8217;re in Toronto, I hope you can make it.
