I know that the true reason people read this blog is for accurate and timely R. Kelly news and information, and I&#8217;m not about to disappoint.

A few weeks ago I wrote here about my excitement for [Trapped in the Closet: Chapters 13-22](http://misener.org/archives/269). According to the booklet of **Double Up**, the new chapters were scheduled to be released July 24th, 2007.

But as eagle-eyed [Tristan](http://tristanhomer.blogspot.com/) noticed, the release date seem to have been pushed back. [Amazon.com now lists](http://www.amazon.com/Trapped-Closet-Chapters-R-Kelly/dp/B000TJ6OWA/ref=sr_1_7/103-5498980-1030228?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1184592371&sr=8-7) it as August 21, 2007.

So until then, your appetite for Kells will have to be satiated by this video Jenna sent me today for &#8220;Same Girl.&#8221;

> <span name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">I didn&#8217;t think there was anyway R. Kelly could top &#8220;Trapped In the Closet,&#8221; but I was wrong. If you can keep from howling with laughter at this R. Kelly/Usher collabo, you&#8217;re a much better person than I am.</span>

Personally, I don&#8217;t know if this tops TitC, but it&#8217;s certainly nice to see that Kelly hasn&#8217;t lost his obsession with infidelity.

I&#8217;m still amazed that I got two separate R. Kelly related emails today.
