And finally, before I go to bed to rest for what is sure to be another thrilling day on the picket line, here&#8217;s a non-lockout related post.

Via the del.icio.us [&#8220;radio&#8221; tag feed](http://del.icio.us/tag/radio) comes a recent Columbia Journalism Review interview with Ira Glass, one of my radio heroes. It&#8217;s called [Ira Glass on Working in Television, Public Radio&#8217;s Struggle For Innovation, and Hanging Up On People](http://www.cjrdaily.org/archives/001738.asp).

Read. Enjoy. Think about making great radio.
