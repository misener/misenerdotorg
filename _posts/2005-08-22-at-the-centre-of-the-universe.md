I&#8217;m in Toronto now.

I arrived late Saturday night, and checked in with the CMG folks outside the Broadcast Centre yesterday. I plan to picket here this week, and am keen to compare/contrast my experience with union-friendly Windsor, Ontario.

Pickets run 24/7 here, and it&#8217;s a &#8220;show up whenever, stay as long as you want&#8221; system. Apparently, Monday-Wednesday are the busiest times. Any recommendations? 

If you&#8217;re on, or passing near the line this week, and see someone who [looks like this](http://flickr.com/photos/danmisener/33799947/) (I&#8217;m on the right), please come say hello. Would love to meet some new people.
