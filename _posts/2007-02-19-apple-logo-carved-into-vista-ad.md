David Topping over at Torontoist has a [nice write-up](http://www.torontoist.com/archives/2007/02/the_war_starts.php) and several photos of the Apple logo carved into a Windows Vista ad I saw last week (image above and on [my Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/danmisener/tags/thewowstartsnow/)):

> A little over a week ago, one user of the tribe.ca forums found the word &#8220;LINUX&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tribemagazine.com/board/showthread.php?t=129705">carved out of a huge Vista ad at Finch Station</a>. A few days after that, photoblogger Photendo found an <a target="_blank" href="http://photendo.com/index.php?showimage=8">Apple logo carved out of the &#8220;o&#8221; in &#8220;Wow&#8221; for a similar Vista promo at Queen Station</a>, and now, at King Station by the Melinda Street exit, someone has done the same thing to the same ad, and (someone else?) has added &#8220;Wow That&#8217;s expensive&#8221; below the knife job in green ink. TouchÃ©.

I don&#8217;t advocate vandalism (or using Microsoft Windows), but this is pretty funny.
