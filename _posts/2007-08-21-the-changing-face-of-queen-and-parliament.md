The intersection of Queen and Parliament &#8212; a major intersection in my new neightbourhood &#8212; seems to be undergoing a bit of a facelift these day. Part of me wonders if its a bit of the Leslieville revamp creeping east. About two years ago, a Shoppers Drug Mart appeared on the southeast corner:

Right next door to the Shoppers, there&#8217;s a brand new TD Canada Trust. According to the sign on the door, it&#8217;s slated to open August 27.

And earlier this week, on the northwest corner, they installed signs for a new Subway franchise:

Oh the times, they are a changin&#8217;.
