Inspired by Peter Rukavina&#8217;s [experiments with mesh networking](http://ruk.ca/article/4352), I ordered three [Meraki Mini](http://meraki.com/products/mini/)s this week, and installed two of them this morning. One sits on a bookshelf in our living room, and the other points north out our back window.

You can see the status of the network, named **Corktown**, [right here online](http://public.meraki.com/network/Corktown). And if you&#8217;re in the neighbourhood, you&#8217;re welcome to use the connection.

I&#8217;d love to try and convince other residents and businesses to jump on the mesh networking bandwagon, but I don&#8217;t really know how to explain the benefits to them. I&#8217;m thinking of a flyer, posted to lamposts at the intersection of Queen and Parliament:

> Dear **[List of neighbourhood SSIDs here]**,
> 
> You probably pay a lot for high-speed internet. I know I do.
> 
> Want to share? Make things cheaper, faster, and better for everyone?
> 
> Let&#8217;s start a wireless mesh network.

Would you bite? I would, but I&#8217;m a geek like that.
