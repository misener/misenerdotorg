My contract at CBC Windsor is officially up on September 4. And with a strike/lockout [looming](http://cbcnegotiations.ca/scripts/index_.asp), job prospects aren&#8217;t looking good for September. 

A while ago, I applied for an Associate Producer job in Vancouver. Today I got an email from HR, letting me know that they&#8217;d &#8220;taken a second look at the technical component of this position, and have decided that it would be more appropriate to [repost as an Association Producer/Technician](https://cbc.recruitsoft.com/servlets/CareerSection?art_ip_action=FlowDispatcher&flowTypeNo=13&pageSeq=2&reqNo=39202&art_servlet_language=en&csNo=2&JServSessionIdcbc=10vhe67nhv5kloo41.RJS245602).&#8221; This may be good news, because AP/tech is my current position in Windsor. Judging by the job description, and what I&#8217;ve been doing this summer, I&#8217;m qualified.

The unposting date is now August 23. I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed.

So right now, the plan for September is to move back to Toronto, and find work as a freelancer, or within the CBL casual pool.
