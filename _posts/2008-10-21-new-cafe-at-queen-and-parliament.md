If there was ever evidence that what&#8217;s happening farther east of us on Queen Street is spreading into Corktown, it&#8217;s the new coffee shop that opened up at [354 Queen East](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=354+queen+street+east,+toronto&sll=43.655671,-79.364238&sspn=0.011488,0.021694&g=354+queen+street+east,+toronto&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr) (next to Ray&#8217;s Convenience). I went by tonight after Jenna texted me to announce its existence, and peered in the windows. I spotted comfy chairs and an espresso machine, so it at least looks better than Coffee Time.

Looking forward to trying it out tomorrow morning, and pitching the owner on mesh networking.
