Lockout left you with too much spare time? Why not take on this project from Engadget: [How-To Build a Telephone Recording Circuit from an Old Modem](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000890060689/). I&#8217;ve used [Skype](http://www.skype.com) and [Audio Hijack Pro](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/) to record telephone conversations before, but I&#8217;ve always been disappointed with the audio quality.

I&#8217;d love to own the [RemoteMix C+](http://www.jkaudio.com/remotemix-cplus.htm) I used to borrow from Ryerson, but it&#8217;s just too expensive for how much I&#8217;d use it.

Anyone with a soldering iron want to help me out with this?
