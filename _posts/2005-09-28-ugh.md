From this morning&#8217;s CMG [bargaining update](http://www.cmg.ca/negotiationsupdatesresults.asp?ID=686&SubjectID=45&BranchID=1):

> Management&#8217;s position is virtually the same as it held before it imposed the lockout.

It&#8217;s hard to know what comments like this mean for reaching a deal, especially with all the optimism on the picket lines, blogs, and mailing lists. I&#8217;m starting to question what Fontana thinks he&#8217;s really doing by [locking negotiators](http://www.friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles09260505.asp) in a room, especially if both sides plan on sticking to their guns.

Part of me just wants to ignore the rumor mill. I still believe that only a handful of people really know how and when this will end.
