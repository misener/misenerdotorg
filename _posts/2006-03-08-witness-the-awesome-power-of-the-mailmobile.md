The CBC&#8217;s Toronto Broadcast Centre has a robot that delivers mail. It&#8217;s a motorized cart that follows a track through the halls. It&#8217;s also equipped with sensors to keep it from running over children and small animals.

Earlier this week, the mailmobile failed to avoid a terracotta pot outside our offices. The destruction is [documented on my Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmisener/tags/mailmobile/).
