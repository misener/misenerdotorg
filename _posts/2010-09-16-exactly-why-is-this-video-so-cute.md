According to &#8220;A Biological Homage to Mickey Mouse&#8221; by Stephen Jay Gould [[PDF](http://www.monmsci.net/~kbaldwin/mickey.pdf)]:

> Humans feed affection for animals with juvenile features: large eyes, bulging craniums, retreating chins (left column). Small-eyed, long-snouted animals (right column) do not elicit the same response. 

So let&#8217;s examine the slow loris. Large eyes? Check. Bulging cranium? Check. Retreating chin? Check. Cutest animal ever.
