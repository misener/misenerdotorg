I started interning at CBL a few weeks ago, and I&#8217;ve been having a blast. Mostly, I&#8217;ve been chase producing for [Metro Morning](http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/). I&#8217;m learning a lot, witnessing the grind of a local morning show, and getting my hands dirty. Plus, I get to write greens for [interviews with Geddy Lee](http://cbc.ca/metromorning/media/20050301PUGMAR1.ram). Who could ask for more?
