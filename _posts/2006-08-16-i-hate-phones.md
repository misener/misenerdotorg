But after moving this past weekend, I realized that I need some kind of telephone.&nbsp;And prices the way they are, the convenience of a cell seemed worth the premium over a land line.

But cell phone companies are evil. They rope you into 2 or 3 year contracts with the lure of cheap or &#8220;free&#8221;&nbsp;phones. And mostly, their &#8220;free&#8221; phones suck. I had a 2 year contract with Bell Mobility&nbsp;that ended in the Spring. It was nothing but headaches, and I resolved to never give them any of my money ever again. Ever.

So I did some research, and figured it out something I&#8217;m pretty happy with:

I picked up&nbsp;an unlocked&nbsp;Hong Kong version of&nbsp;the Motorola SLVR&nbsp;from [Canada Computers](http://www.canadacomputers.com/index.php?do=ShowProduct&cmd=pd&pid=009644&cid=828) at College and Spadina for $219. The same phone, locked to [Rogers Wireless](http://www.shoprogers.com/store/wireless/products/phones/products_details.asp?shopperID=BCD30HV3TQ7B8JU8VETA1M2TMMEE91W9&PRODUCTID=L7R&summary=1), would cost $389.99 without a contract.

Then I walked into Fido at the Eaton Centre, signed up for the recently announced $30/month [Urban plan](http://fido.ca/urban), and&nbsp;ponied up&nbsp;$30 for a Fido SIM card.

So: an unlocked GSM phone, a monthly plan I can change or cancel anytime,&nbsp;and no dealings with <strike>Satan</strike> Bell.&nbsp;Not too bad.

Cell phones suck. Cell phone companies will always rip you off. But this way, I feel like I&#8217;m getting ripped of the least.
