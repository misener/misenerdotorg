<img src="http://thislife.org/images/basics/homegraphics/logo_chris.jpeg" align="right" />Finally, after weeks of drafting, my application to become the This American Life [intern](http://thislife.org/pages/faq_extras/internships.html) for Summer 2005 has been sent. With my questionnaire complete, my references set up, and my resume polished, I walked to the post office today and XpressPosted it all to Chicago.

The whole thing amounted to nine pages. Here&#8217;s hoping they read it. And like it.

The website says &#8220;We will notify all applicants of the decision by the deadlines listed above,&#8221; which in my case, is March 1. If they decide to interview me, I guess I&#8217;ll know sooner.

I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed.
