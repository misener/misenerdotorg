My favourite pizza place in Toronto, [Peter&#8217;s Cajun Creole Pizza](http://www.peterscajunpizza.ca/), is expanding. The former Mr. Tasty location, adjacent to Pete&#8217;s Cajun at Queen and Parliament, is now **Peter&#8217;s Corner**. They installed the sign tonight:

The sign promises:

  * Hamburger
  * Panini
  * Steak
  * Coffee
  * Gelato

But the best part? Their slogan is &#8220;Profile of Excellence.&#8221;

I&#8217;m not quite sure what that means, but I&#8217;m keen to eat there.
