I arrived in Windsor, Ontario yesterday. Tomorrow I start a new job here at CBE, the local CBC Radio One station. Iâ€™ll be working for the summer as a Technician/Associate Producer on Morning Watch and Crosstown, the local morning and afternoon shows. I have a roof over my head, a new bicycle, and a handful of contacts.

Iâ€™m pretty excited.
