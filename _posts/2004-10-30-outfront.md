Poking around the Outfront website, I came across their [Pitch](http://www.cbc.ca/outfront/contribute/) section. I remember looking at this section sometime last year, but I don&#8217;t remember seeing all this. It&#8217;s got helpful hints, a guide to the pitching process, and some basic recording techniques. The material seems to be culled mostly from their old [Tell](http://www.cbc.ca/outfront/tell) section.
