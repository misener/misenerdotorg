So they&#8217;re knocking down the building across the street from my old house. A few weeks ago, fences and concrete barricades surrounded the sidewalk, and suddenly I couldn&#8217;t park my bike there anymore.

Then, sometime over the past couple of days, they started knocking it down. Last night, on our way to the Imperial, I took some photos with Jenna&#8217;s camera:

I don&#8217;t know much about this building, despite living across from it for the better part of a year. I vaguely recall it being labelled on maps as the St. Michael&#8217;s Hospital Annex, but I can&#8217;t seem to find anything to back that up. The [city&#8217;s online map](http://map.toronto.ca/imapit/iMapIt.jsp?app=TOMaps) list 209 Victoria Street as a &#8220;Hospital, Private and Public.&#8221;

There&#8217;s a recent thread over on the [Infiltration board](http://www.uer.ca/forum_showthread.asp?fid=3&threadid=46471) about

> a 3 or 4 story building on the Northeast corner of Shuter and Mutual Sts. in Toronto. I am of the understanding that it has now been converted to some kind of housing: either lofts (unlikely, given the neighbourhood) or low income units (much more likely).
> 
> Prior to the renovation&#8217;s completion, two friends and I made our way into the building. It had a lovely front lobby, large holes in floors where a freight elevator may once have operated, a basement full of a cork-like material, which I believe may have been used in walk-in refrigeration (a suspicion validated by the discovery of a large wooden, insulated door with a freezer style latch attatched to it), and a fantastic view of Yonge St. to the West.

Sounds cool. I wish there were photos.

So what will take the mystery building&#8217;s place? According to [this city staff report](http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2007/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-5292.pdf),

> [Eastern Construction Company Ltd.](http://www.easternconstruction.com/default.asp) is building a 9-storey research and healthcare education centre at 26-38 Shuter Street and 209 Victoria Street, on the north side of Shuter Street between Victoria Street and Bond Street.
