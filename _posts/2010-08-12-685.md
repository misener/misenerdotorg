Earlier this week, I posted about the [CRTC&#8217;s open consultation on basic phone and internet service](http://o2s.publivate.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=68&lang=en), which asks: &#8220;[W]hat role, if any, should the CRTC play in ensuring that all Canadians have access to broadband Internet service at comparable rates?&#8221;

Stateside yesterday, the Pew Internet & American Life Project published a [new report on home broadband](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Home-Broadband-2010.aspx), with some surprising results:

> By a 53%-41% margin, Americans say they do not believe that the spread of affordable broadband should be a major government priority. Contrary to what some might suspect, non-internet users are less likely than current users to say the government should place a high priority on the spread of high-speed connections.

Seems like the majority agrees with [The Thrill](http://misener.org/archives/677#IDComment92337399).
