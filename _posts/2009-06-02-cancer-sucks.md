So I&#8217;m participating in The Canadian Cancer Society&#8217;s [Relay for Life](http://convio.cancer.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=RFL_CAN_home_accueil) with some friends.

Donations to the CCS are good. You know that already, though, right?

You can [pledge here](http://convio.cancer.ca/goto/misener).
