As I&#8217;ve [mentioned before](http://misener.org/archives/488), I&#8217;m in a brand new rock and roll back band called **The Sweat**.

We play Spinal Tap-inspired tough-guy rock, with tongue planted firmly in cheek.

We&#8217;re playing our first ever full-length show this Thursday, July 9 at the [El Mocambo](http://www.elmocambo.ca/) with two other bands: [Huron](http://www.myspace.com/huronband) and Sandman Viper Command. We&#8217;d love to see you there.

There&#8217;s a [Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=98825694770) for the show, if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing.
