A few months ago, I wrote a bit about Kickstarter, and how they hide (or at the very least, [make it very difficult to find](http://misener.org/archives/1354)) failed projects.

I believe that when it comes to crowdfunding, there&#8217;s much to learn from past projects &#8212; both successes _and_ failures. And I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way. Early on in [The Crowdfunding Bible](http://www.crowdfundingguides.com/), Scott Steinberg writes:

> Whatever your approach to crowdfunding, your first order of business is to take a hard, analytical look at projects that have succeeded, as well as ventures that have failed. Your goal: To observe and learn how successful projects work, and to understand the subtle nuances and tactics that determine why some triumph while others don&#8217;t.

By hiding failed projects, Kickstarter makes it difficult for aspiring crowdfunders to take a hard, analytical look at &#8220;ventures that have failed.&#8221;

With this in mind, I built a Kickstarter research tool.

It&#8217;s called [The KickBack Machine](http://www.thekickbackmachine.com), and it&#8217;s specifically designed to help aspiring artists, creators, and entrepreneurs do their crowdfunding homework.

**For example:** Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a hip-hop artist and I want to raise $10,000 for my next album. The KickBack Machine lets me find examples of [past hip-hop projects that tried to raise approximate $10,000](http://www.thekickbackmachine.com/browse/all/Music/Hip-Hop/goal/10000/).

Here&#8217;s a short intro video I made to explain the tool:



The site has limitations. Notably, it only knows about Kickstarter projects that ended after mid-June 2012, and you can currently only filter by category and project goal. But it&#8217;s a start, and it should be at least somewhat useful in its current form.

If you&#8217;re an artist, creator, or entrepreneur who&#8217;s considering Kickstarter as a crowdfunding service, I&#8217;d encourage you to check out [The KickBack Machine](http://www.thekickbackmachine.com). I&#8217;d love to hear your suggestions for how it could be a more useful tool.
