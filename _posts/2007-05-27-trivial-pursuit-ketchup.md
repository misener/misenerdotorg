On Saturday afternoon, Jenna and I went to the [Hero Certified Burger](http://www.heroburgers.com/) at King and Yonge for lunch. I grabbed a handful of those little ketchup packets, and noticed that Heinz now prints Trivial Pursuit questions on their single-serving ketchups:

[<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/225/515689975_7a5f079954.jpg" title="Trivial Pursuit ketchup" alt="Trivial Pursuit ketchup" border="0" height="375" width="500" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmisener/515689975/ "Photo Sharing")

This is a great idea.

But it falls short online. As far as I can tell, the website listed on the package ([www.heinzitup.com](http://www.heinzitup.com/)) makes no mention of the campaign, nor does [www.heinztrivialpursuit.com](http://www.heinztrivialpursuit.com).
