Ira Glass, in [an interview with Marc Maron](http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-117-ira-glass):

> There&#8217;s this thing that Keith, my mentor, used to say, where he says, &#8220;A story, if it&#8217;s working, is always an answer to the question, &#8216;How should I live my life?'&#8221;

What an interesting lens.
