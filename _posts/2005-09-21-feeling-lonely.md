> _Radio affects most people intimately, person-to-person, offering a world of unspoken communication between writer-speaker and the listener. That is the immediate aspect of radio. A private experience._

When I was in junior high school, towards the end of grade eight, I started to deliver the Halifax Daily News. Every weekday morning, I was up and out the door by six, to have my route done by seven.

For my birthday that year, I asked for and got a small radio walkman. I still have it. And I listened to it every morning for the three years I delivered the Daily News. Through the week, the voices of Don Connolly and Elizabeth Logan kept me company. On the streets near my parents&#8217; house in Lower Sackville, I fell in love with CBC Radio.

Honestly, I can&#8217;t remember the details of a single interview from those years. But I do remember how listening to _Information Morning_ made me feel. Though I was technically alone delivering papers, it didn&#8217;t seem that way. At 13, was I that interested in traffic reports? Or city council? I doubt it. But I listened.

When I moved to Toronto two years ago, I didn&#8217;t know anyone here. For the first little while, I spent a lot of time alone, listening to the radio. I sat in my dorm room, listening to countless episodes of _This American Life_. I listened to Andy Barrie in the mornings; _Metro Morning_ helped shape my ideas about the city. Again, though I was, I didn&#8217;t feel alone. 

People sometimes ask me what I love about radio. It&#8217;s not necessarily about _what_ I&#8217;m listening to or working on. I understand that radio has utility &#8212; to inform, to enlighten, to entertain, to stimulate &#8212; but to me, its greatest power, and what I love most about it, is how makes me feel like I&#8217;ve got a friend when I&#8217;m all by myself.

Lately, for the first time in a while, I&#8217;ve felt lonely when I&#8217;m alone. And I don&#8217;t want to anymore.
