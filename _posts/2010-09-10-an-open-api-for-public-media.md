So, [according to Poynter](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&aid=190361), all the big US public media organizations are getting together to work on an open API:

> &#8220;I really err on the side of openness and inclusiveness,&#8221; [CEO of PRX Jake] Shapiro said. Public media, he said, is uniquely suited for this work because of its public service mission &#8212; &#8220;to make sure content that reflects public dollars is accessible in the most broad and relevant way possible.&#8221;

Amen. This open API, or &#8220;Public Media Platform&#8221; as they&#8217;re calling it, brings together American Public Media, PRX, PRI, PBS, and NPR.

Notably (but not surprisingly) absent from this list: a certain large Canadian public media company.
