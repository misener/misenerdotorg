PRX&#8217;s Jake Shapiro, on what he calls the [public media developer gap](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2011/11/public-media-should-mind-the-developer-gap330.html):

> I look around our public media field and beyond and see a worrisome gap.
> 
> As public broadcasting goes through its own turbulent transition to a new Internet and mobile world, the technology talent gap is a risk that looms large. Yes, there are many other challenges: political and policy battles, business model pressures, cultural and structural obstacles, the need for strategic vision and leadership. And there are other recruitment needs across general management, content, fundraising. But the twin coins of the new digital realm are code and design, and with a few notable exceptions, public media is seriously lacking in both.

Spot on, and pitch perfect. This is a huge part of the reason I&#8217;m [taking a year off, moving to France](http://misener.org/archives/1088) and teaching myself to be [a programmer-journalist](http://misener.org/archives/606).

Here&#8217;s hoping they let me start CBC Labs when I get back.
