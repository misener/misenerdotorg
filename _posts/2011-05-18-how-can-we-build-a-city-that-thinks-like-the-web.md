People have different names for it: the networked city, the real-time city, the smart city, &#8220;[a city that thinks like the web](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/city-thinks-like-the-web/).&#8221; Call it what you want, the idea of improving the places we live through technology, open data, and connectivity is definitely hotting up these days.

MIT has an [entire lab dedicated to the exploration of that idea](http://senseable.mit.edu/), where researchers [attach tiny cell phones to trash](http://senseable.mit.edu/trashtrack/), and build award-winning [networked bicycle wheels](http://senseable.mit.edu/copenhagenwheel/).

Events like the [Cognitive Cities Conference](http://conference.cognitivecities.com/) in Berlin attract a diverse collection of &#8220;urban planners, designers, technology geeks, environmental experts, public officials, urban gardening enthusiasts and cultural influencers,&#8221; where high fliers like [Adam Greenfield](https://speedbird.wordpress.com/) are treated a bit like rock stars (if rock stars were obsessed with ubiquitous computing).

The networked city is also fertile ground for artistic work, like [John Ewing&#8217;s Virtual Street Corners](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2010/06/full-interview-john-ewing-on-virtual-street-corners/) project, which transformed two street-level shopfronts into a large-scale videoconference last year.

But running alongside the potential benefits of a networked city are risks (like overextended surveillance and control) and unintended consequences ([like crime maps&#8217; impact on housing prices](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1221604/Online-crime-maps-wipe-thousands-house-prices-overnight.html)). And though much of the underlying technology for networked cities exists today, we don&#8217;t yet have well-established social norms and protocols for living in such places. Our fluid, contextual notions of public and private often bump up against the binary on/off nature of digital technology in all sorts of surprising and unexpected ways.

All this to say, I&#8217;m really excited to explore some of these issues soon with three big thinkers: Cory Doctorow (Boing Boing), Mark Surman (Mozilla) and Sara Diamond (OCAD University). I&#8217;m moderating a panel discussion with them on June 4, called &#8220;How can we build a city that thinks like the web?&#8221; Of course, we&#8217;ll address the titular question, with the requisite follow-up,Â &#8220;_Should_ we build a city that thinks like the web?&#8221;

It&#8217;s free and open to the public, but [pre-registration](http://citythathinksliketheweb.eventbrite.com/) is required.

Hope to see you there. Really looking forward to it.
