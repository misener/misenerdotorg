It&#8217;s been a summer of mobile phone announcements. The Droid X. The iPhone 4. The Blackberry 9800 is expected to be announced on Tuesday. And there&#8217;s been a lot of talk: &#8220;Should I upgrade to the new iPhone 4?&#8221; &#8220;Should I switch to an Android?&#8221;

Strangely, there&#8217;s little talk of _downgrading_ to a &#8220;dumbphone.&#8221; You know, a plain old cell phone that makes calls, sends texts, and not much else.

About six weeks ago, I sold my used iPhone 3G, and I&#8217;ve been living with just such a dumbphone: a [Motorola L7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_SLVR_L7). As it turns out, I&#8217;m not the only one living life without a data plan and full QWERTY keyboard. Only 15-17% of the world&#8217;s cell phones are classified as &#8220;smartphones,&#8221; which means the vast majority of cell phones are **not** smart.

Still, the smarties get all the press.

So, what&#8217;s life like with a dummy? After the initial shaking, tears, and denial, I was surprised at how easy it was to shed my data plan. And there have been noticeable benefits:

  * I&#8217;m way less compulsive about checking email/Twitter/random trivia
  * I&#8217;m way more observant about the world around me. I pay more attention, because I&#8217;m less distracted.
  * My dumbphone is way cheaper to operate. My Fido bill for July was $15.63, compared to $80-85/month with the iPhone

For my CBC tech column this week, I&#8217;m talking about the virtues of the dumbphone: why regular old cell phones aren&#8217;t necessarily sexy, but are still a good choice for many people.

**Do you have a dumbphone? Do you love it?** I&#8217;d love to know why. Leave a comment or shoot me an email: <dan@misener.org>
