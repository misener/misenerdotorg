Not only is Queen and Parliament the intersection to buy pizza at, but it seems our corner&#8217;s concentration of furniture stores is rising. 

Arabesque, the carpet store we live above, seems to have closed. The showroom is now full of furniture. 

So now, there&#8217;s Marty Millionaire, Gen-cor, and this new place, all within spitting distance of each other.
