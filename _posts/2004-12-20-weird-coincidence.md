Re-listened to the &#8220;Bullies&#8221; episode of [Wiretap](http://www.cbc.ca/wiretap/) last night before going to bed. The episode featured [John Hodgman](http://www.transom.org/guests/specialguests/johnhodgman.html) talking about winning.

After the episode was over, I picked up the copy of [Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400042240/qid=1103601973/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/702-0388433-1620836) that [Carmody](http://asiamwellaware.blogspot.com/) gave me for Christmas, and turned to where I&#8217;d left off. Strangely enough, the next piece was &#8220;Fire: The Next Sharp Stick?&#8221; by none other than John Hodgman.

Weird.
