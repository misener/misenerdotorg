Last Monday, upstairs at the Victory Cafe, I hosted the very first **Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids** &#8212; an evening of childhood poems, schoolwork, and diary readings. I was really worried that nobody would show up, and that I&#8217;d have to read from my Grade 1 journal all alone, for an hour.

But that didn&#8217;t happen. The night was amazingly well-attended (standing room only on a Monday night), and everyone who read did a great job. readings were funny, and sad, and embarrassing, and wonderful.

And, the night caught the attention of some media-types. On Monday morning, Tori Allen talked about it on her [What&#8217;s Goin&#8217; On](http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/whats_goin_on/) column. Then [Gadzooks featured GRTTWAK in its latest episode](http://www.gogadzooks.com/episodes_2/episode_73/episode73.htm). And today, Leah McLaren wrote about it in [her Globe column](http://www.rbcinvest.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/LAC/20070224/LEAH24/Columnists/columnists/columnistsStyle/2/2/3/).

**Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids** was so much fun the first time, I&#8217;ve decided to do it again. I&#8217;ve booked the sequel for Monday, April 30, 2007 at 8:00 PM, upstairs at [The Victory Cafe](http://www.victorycafe.ca/).

That means if you couldn&#8217;t make it to the first one, you have some time to track down that old diary or get your mom to send you that shoebox full of schoolwork.

I&#8217;ll post everything related to the reading series at [http://www.danmisener.com/read/](http://misener.org/read/)
