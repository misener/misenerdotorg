After hearing [Jeffrey Blitz](http://imdb.com/name/nm0998825/) a few days ago (on my new favourite radio show [The Sound of Young America](http://www.maximumfun.org)), I decided to watch [Rocket Science](http://imdb.com/title/tt0477078/), which I just finished.

The [soundtrack](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=259842964&s=143455), mostly by [Eef Barzelay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eef_Barzelay), is excellent.

Expect to hear selections soon on a public radio program near you, if you haven&#8217;t already.
