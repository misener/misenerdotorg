[Now they do](http://cbcirc.appspot.com/).

I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about radio and live chat ever since I started listening to shows on Dan Benjamin&#8217;s [5by5](http://www.5by5.tv/) network.

You see, many of the shows on 5by5 are recorded live. If you&#8217;re so inclined, you can [tune into these shows and listen along in real time as they&#8217;re recorded](http://www.5by5.tv/live). What&#8217;s more, 5by5 has an IRC channel, so in addition to live streaming audio, there&#8217;s often a chatroom full of people engaged a meta-discussion about the shows _as they happen._

Naturally, I wondered if something similar was possible for CBC Radio.

[So I coded up a little website](http://cbcirc.appspot.com/).

Essentially, it&#8217;s CBC Radio + IRC.

Using information from the [CBC&#8217;s official program guide](http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/), the site figures out which shows are currently on-air, then generates IRC channels so people who are listening to the same show can chat with each other.

It&#8217;s an experiment. But I&#8217;m curious to know what you think.
