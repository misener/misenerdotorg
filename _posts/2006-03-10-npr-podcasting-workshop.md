Via the always informative BoingBoing comes a link to [AudioLuxe](http://www.audioluxe.org/crashcourse.html), advertising a &#8220;Content Crash Course for Podcasters&#8221; run by NPR producers, at an [NPR station](http://www.kqed.org):

> Why should professional broadcasters have the monopoly on quality? DIY doesn&#8217;t have to be dull! Learn the tips, tricks, and time-tested techniques professional public broadcasters use to capture and keep a listener&#8217;s attention.
