Lee Rainnie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life project, from [this week&#8217;s On the Media](http://onthemedia.org/transcripts/2009/11/20/05), speaking about social isolation and internet use:

> For centuries, when new technologies come on the scene thereâ€™s almost an instinctive human reaction, particularly among those who are challenged by the new technology, to blame the technology for any social ill that happens to arise at the same time. Something has gone on with our social networks in the past 20 years. Our data matched the data that the previous researchers had collected showing the networks are shrinking.
> 
> And so, now we&#8217;re inviting other social scientists and researchers like ourselves to go out and find the real culprit and not just think that the Internet lies behind it just because the Internet was being adopted at the same time this harmful social trend was emerging.

Reminds me a bit of Russell Davies&#8217;s [The Internet Isn&#8217;t Killing Anything](http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2009/11/the-internet-isnt-killing-anything.html).
