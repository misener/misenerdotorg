From [CKDU](http://ckdu.ca/).ca, about the Valentine&#8217;s Day move to high power:

> At 1:00 PM AST, CKDU 97.5 FM will cease to broadcast.
> 
> At 7:00 PM AST, CKDU 88.1 FM will rise like a phoenix out of the 97.5 ashes. 
> 
> Tune in for exciting live programming hosted by Nick Barrington (Elegant Voltage) and featuring a stable of our wonderful programmers and volunteers.

This has been a long time coming. Congrats to my Haligonian radio colleagues.
