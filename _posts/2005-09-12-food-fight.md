Over on his [blog](http://cbcworkerbee.blogspot.com/2005/09/food-fight.html), CBC Workerbee has proposed a lockout blog food fight. I don&#8217;t have any great recipes to share (Tim Hortons and KD are staples in my diet), but I know two gentlemen who do: Mat and Dave from [Let&#8217;s Get Baked with Mat and Dave](http://letsgetbaked.ckdu.ca/).

If you don&#8217;t know, Let&#8217;s Get Baked is Halifax&#8217;s premiere vegan baking show. While in Halifax last week, I got to visit the famed Allen Street Kitchens and enjoy several delicious vegan pies.

Season Two just got underway, and their [podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/LetsGetBakedPodcast) has provided me with some excellent picket-line listening.
