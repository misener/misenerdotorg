It seems as though Church and Richmond has become the new little Thailand in Toronto. This evening as Jenna and I walked back from the grocery store, we noticed that the ground level of the building that used to house the Rockit (and the the Speakeasy) is now a [Spring Rolls](http://www.springrolls.ca/).

If you ask me, it&#8217;s a pretty dumb place to open a chain Thai restaurant, what with the incredible [Golden Thai](http://www.toronto.com/restaurants/listing/000-212-805) directly across the street, and [Young Thailand](http://www.youngthailand.com/) just south. Not to mention an almost identical Spring Rolls restaurant [half a kilometer away](http://www.google.ca/maps?daddr=85+Front+Street+East,+Toronto,+ON+M5E+1B8+(Spring+Rolls+By+St+Lawrence+Market)+%4043.648900,-79.372362&saddr=120+Church+St,+Toronto,+ON&f=d&hl=en&dq=spring+rolls+loc:+Toronto,+ON&ie=UTF8&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=31.540637,71.191406&om=1).

Weird.
