If, like me, you&#8217;ve been driven to the brink of insanity by janky text formatting during a copy/paste manouver, you&#8217;ll appreciate [PureText](http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/). It&#8217;s a tiny little Windows app that I&#8217;ve been using for the past few weeks on my CBC PC. Copy anything to your Windows clipboard, and PureText will strip all formatting:

> This includes the font face, font style (bold, italics, etc.), font color, paragraph styles (left/right/center aligned), margins, character spacing, bullets, subscript, superscript, tables, charts, pictures, embedded objects, etc. However, it does not modify the actual text.

Just the text, ma&#8217;am. I love it.
