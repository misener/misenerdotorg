I remember the very first time I heard **[This American Life](http://www.thislife.org)**. Shelley Robinson was the PD (or maybe station coordinator) at CKDU at the time, and I was doing my show, _Dickey Drive_, and she suggested that I check out Ira Glass and his show online. I wrote down the web address ([thislife.org](http://www.thislife.org)) on a scrap of cardboard, stuck it in my pocket, and forgot about it for several weeks.

When I finally got around to listening to TAL, I was floored. It was unlike anything I&#8217;d heard on the radio before. To my ears it was fresh and exciting, and I couldn&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d not heard of it before. After listening to several episodes, it became radio&#8217;s gold standard in my mind (something that has since caused me much great frustration with my own work, [along these lines explained by Ira](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hidvElQ0xE)). Anyway, my point is that TAL told stories in ways I&#8217;d not heard before, in ways that seemed really inventive, and got me very excited about making radio.

And again, just today, I heard _another_ program that excites me in very much the same way.

Over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve had a couple people ask me if I&#8217;d heard any of [Radio Lab](http://www.radiolab.org) out of WNYC. I hadn&#8217;t, so I made a mental note to check it out, which I didn&#8217;t until this afternoon. I downloaded a couple of shows to my iPod, and listened to the first episode of season three. It&#8217;s all about the [Placebo effect](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2007/05/18).

**Holy crap, this is great sounding show.** Production-wise, it blows my mind. Almost every element is perfect. The division between narration and tape almost doesn&#8217;t exist. The whole thing sounds seamless. They producers use sound in such interesting ways. Not just music, and narration, and clips, but ambiances, sound effects, snippets of mic checks, and actors. I just love how the show is cut together, and how they tell stories with sound.

Seriously, [download the MP3](http://audio.wnyc.org/radiolab/radiolab051807pod.mp3), and listen to the first three minutes.

If you&#8217;re at all interested in making radio stories, study [Radio Lab](http://www.radiolab.org) closely. I certainly plan to.
