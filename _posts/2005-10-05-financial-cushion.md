An email from the CMG cleared up the question, &#8220;Will Dan get a signing bonus, even though he has no job to return to?&#8221;

> CBC management has also committed to depositing the $1,000 signing bonus in employees&#8217; accounts by the end of the day on Wednesday October 12. Everyone who was on the CBC payroll as of August 14, 2005, including casual employees who worked at least 13 weeks between April 1, 2004 and August 14, 2005, qualify for the signing bonus.

This, along with the 2.5 percent retroactive salary increase should make the next couple of weeks a little easier.
