Turns out we&#8217;re playing the Horseshoe this **Monday, April 2**, around 10pm or so.

Now, I know it&#8217;s a Monday night, but there are at least three good reasons to come to this show:

  1. We&#8217;re opening for a band called [The Manvils](http://www.themanvils.com/), who seem pretty cool. The Georgia Straight called them the &#8220;Best Vancouver Band 2006.&#8221; And according to their website, they&#8217;re headlining at the Knitting Factory in NYC soon.
  2. The Canaries will have copies of our new CD for sale at the door. They&#8217;re shiny, and pretty, and sound halfway decent. And I think they&#8217;re five dollars, which isn&#8217;t too bad, all things considered.
  3. Mr. Frank Sinclair promises to tell a funny joke.

So, if you can make it out to the Horseshoe on Monday night, it&#8217;d be great to see you.
