I just got back to Windsor from Toronto, where I spent a few days [graduating from Ryerson](http://www.ryecast.ryerson.ca/dmpstreams/ConvocationSpring2005/June8AM/highbandwidth.asx). I return with a strong desire to get my new podcast/radio show off the ground.

Although I haven&#8217;t written about it here before, I mentioned it at the TO podcaster meetup, and the idea made its way onto Tod&#8217;s [I Love Radio.org](http://radio.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/6/8/919944.html). So here&#8217;s the basic concept:

A weekly 30-minute radio show and podcast called **Hey, Let&#8217;s Go Do Something**, in which I learn about my new home (Windsor, Ontario) by doing stuff with locals. I pick a local, and they pick the activity. It might be preparing for a yard sale. It might be painting parking spaces at midnight. Who knows?

I&#8217;ve met the staff at [CJAM](http://www.cjam.ca), the University of Windsor&#8217;s campus/community radio station, and I hope we can talk next week about the possibility of distributing it both online _and_ on-air.

Why is this a good idea? Well, if it works,

  * I get to learn more about my community 
      * I have an excuse to talk to strangers 
          * I get to introduce cool people and activities to others 
              * By distributing it weekly via CJAM, I have a deadline. I need deadlines. </ul> 
                As I&#8217;ve mentioned, I&#8217;d like to get this going before iTunes supports podcasting. With my afternoons free here in Windsor, I&#8217;ve got nothing stopping me but myself.
                
                Thoughts? Suggestions? Know anybody in Windsor with whom I can spend half an hour? Let me know.
