A few months back, we made a recording, and had a bunch of CDs pressed. Several hundred, if I recall correctly. Though we&#8217;ve not yet &#8220;officially&#8221; released the CD, we&#8217;ve sold them at the past couple of shows.

And now, according to Frank, you can buy [our recording on iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=253155036&s=143455). Which is kind of cool.

Or, if you&#8217;re interested and would like to buy a proper, physical CD, I&#8217;ll sell you one for the low low price of five Canadian dollars. That&#8217;s a whole $4.90 less than the digital version. Just email me.

Our guitarist Mike and his wife Catherine had a pair of babies in March, which meant some time off for the band. But getting ready to get back at it, and we&#8217;re playing a couple of shows in June. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.
