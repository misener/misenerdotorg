After a summer squatting at [The Fifth Column](http://tvo.org/fifthcolumn), [Jesse Brown](http://jessebrown.ca/) now has a [proper blog over at TVO](http://tvo.org/searchengine), and in the [first episode](http://www.tvo.org/cfmx/tvoorg/searchengine/index.cfm?page_id=613&action=blog&subaction=viewPost&post_id=10947&blog_id=485) of this season&#8217;s _Search Engine_ he interviews his radio hero (and mine) Ira Glass about how the internet has changed public radio: [audio:http://www.tvo.org/podcasts/searchengine/audio/SE\_Full\_20090914\_800699\_GlassOnTheNet\_0x0\_40k.mp3] 

If you&#8217;re a public radio geek, it&#8217;s really worth a listen, if only to hear Jesse try to contain his obvious man-crush on Ira.
