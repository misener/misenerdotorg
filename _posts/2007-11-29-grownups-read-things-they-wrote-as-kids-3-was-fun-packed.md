I&#8217;m a little late posting this, seeing as the event was almost two weeks ago, but I have to say: the third [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://misener.org/read/) was an awful lot of fun.

It was also well-attended. Some might say a little too well-attended.

Thanks no doubt to some pimping by [Torontoist](http://torontoist.com/2007/11/grownups_read_t.php), [BlogTO](http://www.blogto.com/books_lit/2007/11/grownups_read_things_they_wrote_as_kids/), and [Here and Now](http://www.cbc.ca/hereandnowtoronto/), a lot of people showed up.  So many people, in fact, that we spilled into the side of the Victory that lacked sightlines to the stage.

I think perhaps we have outgrown our home at the [Victory Cafe](http://www.victorycafe.ca/), lovely as it is (especially after the new bar installation). I&#8217;m afraid the next event will probably have to take place elsewhere, unless we can reconfigure the newly-reconfigured room. Speaking of the next event, it will probably happen in early-ish 2008, probably February or March.  If anyone has suggestions for a slightly larger venue, please leave them here or [drop me a line](http://misener.org/contact).

Thanks to everyone who came out to the event, either to read or to listen.

It&#8217;s a real treat to see this thing start to take off.
