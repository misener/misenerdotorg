Honestly, I haven&#8217;t paid as much attention as I&#8217;d like to the [Toronto Standard](http://www.torontostandard.com), the newish web-only daily. But yesterday morning, one of their video features really caught my eye.

It&#8217;s a short feature on [Don Taylor](http://www.dontaylorbookbinder.com/), a local bookbinder who&#8217;s been in business for 31 years. 



Directed and Edited by [Tate Young](http://www.tateyoung.com/). Produced and written by [Ian Daffern](http://www.iandaffern.ca/).

Really lovely portrait of a craftsman.
