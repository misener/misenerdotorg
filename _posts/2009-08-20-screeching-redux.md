Yup, [the screeching](http://misener.org/archives/520) is back, as of this morning:

> The TTC has scheduled streetcar service to resume along the Queen Street East [bridge across the Don River](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2009/08/06-don_river_.shtml) at 5 a.m. today. [Construction at Church and Queen Streets](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2009/07/13-church_que.shtml) continues to disrupt streetcar service.

Via [Transit Toronto](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/weblog/2009/08/20-calendar_s.shtml)
