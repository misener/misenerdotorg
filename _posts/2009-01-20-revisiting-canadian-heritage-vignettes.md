A few years ago, when Tristan and I lived at 298 Jarvis, alongside shooting episodes of [Jim Dupree](http://www.collectiveproductions.com/jimdupree/), we started a short-lived side project called **Canadian Heritage Vignettes**. We only made three episodes, all shot with the video mode of a [Casio Exilim EX-S500](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0506/05060901casio_exs500.asp) still camera. The joke, of course, was that they had nothing at all to do with Canadian heritage. In our defense, though, they were vignettes.

So then, collected here for your enjoyment, all three episodes of **Canadian Heritage Vignettes**. My favourite is episode three, in which Tristan accidently drops his iBook.

## Episode One: Tristan finds Dan&#8217;s photo on Google Image Search



## Episode Two: Dan examines the ingredients used in Ruffles potato chips



## Episode Three: Tristan asks Dan for the remote control
