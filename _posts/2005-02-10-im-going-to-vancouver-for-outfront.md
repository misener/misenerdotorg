I&#8217;m going on a road trip. A trip from [Vancouver to Banff](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=from%20vancouver%2C%20bc%20to%20banff%2C%20ab) to return a stolen headstone to its original cemetery.

I am, of course, bringing my tape recorder and making a doc for my senior practicum. Plus, today I got the good news from Steve Wadhams that I&#8217;ll be producing the whole thing for [Outfront](http://www.cbc.ca/outfront/).
