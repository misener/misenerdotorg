Late last week, I wrote about how [Kickstarter was quietly removing projects from their site, despite claiming otherwise](http://misener.org/despite-claiming-otherwise-kickstarter-quietly-removes-projects/). The removed projects were replaced with a simple message stating: &#8220;Sorry, this project is no longer available.&#8221;

To date, at least 14 projects have been taken down in this way ([Kicktraq has a good list](http://www.kicktraq.com/search/?find=is:deleted&sort=new)). Most of the takedowns seem to be related to intellectual property disputes.

[Commenting on the story in a piece for Wired](http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/kickstarter-takedowns/), I suggested that Kickstarter should be more transparent when it comes to this issue:

> Dan Misener, who runs Kickstarter project-tracking site The KickBack Machine, says Kickstarter should be clear about its policies, and provide a public explanation when it removes a project. “There’s a built-in public education opportunity here, and it would indeed be more transparent,” says Misener.

This morning, I was pleased to notice that for at least one removed project, Kickstarter is now being more transparent about _why_ it was taken down. The project page for [enclave eyewear: twenty&twenty line](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/124039987/enclave-eyewear-twentyandtwenty-line) now looks like this:

<img src="http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-25-at-8.11.55-AM-528x306.png" alt="Project is the subject of an intellectual property dispute and currently unavailable." title="IP Dispute" width="528" height="306" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1464" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-25-at-8.11.55-AM-528x306.png 528w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-25-at-8.11.55-AM-1024x593.png 1024w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-25-at-8.11.55-AM.png 1114w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" />

Rather than an opaque &#8220;Sorry, this project is no longer available&#8221; message, the text reads:

> **enclave eyewear: twenty&twenty line is the subject of an intellectual property dispute and currently unavailable.**
> 
> No need to check the servers — the rest of Kickstarter is doing just fine.
> 
> Thanks for your patience.

This does look like progress, and kudos to Kickstarter for making the change.

But it still doesn&#8217;t address my initial concern that Kickstarter is saying one thing and doing another. They continue to remove projects from their site, yet their [FAQ still claims](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creator%20questions#HowLongDoesAProjRemaOnKick) that projects remain on their site &#8220;Forever! Projects are not closed or taken down, they remain on site for reference and transparency.&#8221;
