Following the discussion on [Darryl&#8217;s blog](http://www.yougeek.ca/) led me to an [Anglican priest](http://frelliott.blogspot.com/2005/08/oh-my-beloved-cbc.html)&#8216;s take on the lockout:

> As a member of the clergy I am extremely concerned for the welfare of our public institutions because I see the need for and the benefit of them. We need to be kept informed of what is going on in this world of ours and that is something the CBC did very well. I pray that this situation will be resolved quickly and for the benefit of all.
