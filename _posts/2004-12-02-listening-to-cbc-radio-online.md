Often, if I hear something on the CBC that I&#8217;d like to record, or if I want to &#8220;time-shift&#8221; radio, I simply wait a while and pick up an online feed from the next time zone over. And for the geographically challenged, this [list of direct URLs](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/streams.html) beats the pants off the [regular map](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/) of stations that stream.
