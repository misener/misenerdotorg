I&#8217;m playing a couple of sets tonight (Friday, August 25) at the [Free Times Cafe](http://www.freetimescafe.com) in Toronto, with [The Canaries](http://www.thecanaries.com) and [Ainsley McNeaney](http://www.ainsleymcneaney.com). From Ainsley&#8217;s email:

> THIS FRIDAY! &nbsp;Check us out @ the Free Times Cafe for a full evening of live musicâ€¦ &nbsp;The show starts at 8:30pm and will feature members of Toronto indie band The Canaries to open, and â€“ of course &#8211; the musical talents of my wonderful ensemble: Dean Pomeroy, Dan Misener, Tricia Mangat, Miguel Malaco, Kristine Grey and Cait Boyle.
