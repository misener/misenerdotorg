[iSquint](http://www.isquint.org/getit.php), the fantastic free video compression tool for the Mac has been discontinued along with its big brother VisualHub and second cousin AudialHub.

I know Tristan used iSquint to prep every single episode of [Jim Dupree](http://www.collectiveproductions.com/jimdupree) for the web.

It&#8217;ll be missed.
