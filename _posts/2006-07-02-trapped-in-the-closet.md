I had houseguests this weekend. [Laura](http://www.justfriends.ca/peek/) and [Michael](http://shufflerepeat.blogspot.com/) had a day off from their tour with Buck 65, and stayed over on Saturday night. Michael brought a copy of R. Kelly&#8217;s [Trapped in the Closet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_In_The_Closet).

It was probably the single best thing I have seen in a very long time. If you&#8217;re like me, and haven&#8217;t seen (or heard about) it, TITC is basically an epic 45-minute music video in 12 parts. We watched it all the way through, and immediately afterwards, watched the commentary mix.

I was told to throw away all my preconceived notions of R. Kelly, and boy am I glad I did.

Rent it. Or rather, buy it. It&#8217;s that good.

Or if you&#8217;re cheap, just watch it on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=026150F42E5D7A06).
