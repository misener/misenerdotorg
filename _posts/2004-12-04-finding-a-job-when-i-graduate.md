Soon, my thoughts will turn to demo reels and resumes. Last year I peppered the east coast with shiny discs, and looking back, I wish I&#8217;d known about [Broadcast Dialogue&#8217;s Broadcast Directory Search](http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/directory_provlevel.asp?searchLevel=province&searchCategory=Radio%20Stations). It lists Canadian radio stations geographically, and gives you contacts, staff listings, corporate ownership information, and the date the info was last updated. Lots of private radio contacts, but sadly, bare-bones CBC info.

But&#8230; the CBC publishes a little pamphlet called [Wondering Where to Find Us: Frequency Guide 2003/2004](http://www.flickr.com/photos/20565074@N00/sets/48656/). The information is almost identical to the frequency guide [online](http://www.cbc.ca/frequency/), with an important exception: CBC production centres have an asterisk next to them. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a job as a CBC Radio producer, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to know the names of the higher-ups at these stations.
