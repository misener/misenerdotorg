This past week, I started my part-time job as a &#8220;Digital Media Assistant&#8221; here at Ryerson. My job is to sit in the 229 digital media lab and help people with software. Since I work evenings and weekends, there is rarely anyone in the lab. So it&#8217;s a great opportunity for me to work on schoolwork, features, and pitches.

Tonight, for example, I&#8217;ve been listening to This American Life&#8217;s [Apologies](http://thislife.org/pages/descriptions/04/277.html) episode. Act two is particularly moving. I&#8217;ve been checking [Jobs@CBC/Radio-Canada](http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/jobs/). I&#8217;ve also been looking through Tod Maffin&#8217;s [Radio Freelance Opportunity Database](https://www.quickbase.com/db/baaxbh5tp). Am particularly looking forward to more details on [pitching](https://www.quickbase.com/db/baaxbh5tp?a=dr&r=bx&rl=c) to [CBC Radio 3](http://www.cbcradio3.com). I submitted a story idea to the [CBC Fresh Voice](http://www.cbc.ca/freshvoice/) competition, but I really think it&#8217;s more suited to an online radio/photo essay.

I like pitching to shows. I think it&#8217;s a good habit to get into. I try to pitch as many stories as I can, not necessarily because I&#8217;m interested in doing (or even able to do) them, but because the act of pitching is a skill I think I should be developing. With every phone call I make or email I send to a prospective commissioner, I think I&#8217;m getting better. Feedback is generally helpful, and I try to use it to make future pitches better. By the time I might have to rely on my pitching skills, I want to be really good at it.

Tod&#8217;s database is a great idea. So is [the AIR pitch page](http://www.airmedia.org/ops/pitches.php). Resources like this are wonderful for independent producers, especially in an age where we may have to sell the same story to multiple shows/networks. I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about intellectual property rights when it comes to radio. More on that later.
