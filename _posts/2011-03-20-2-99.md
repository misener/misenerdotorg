Once upon a time, I was in a rock and roll band called [The Canaries](http://radio3.cbc.ca/bands/The-Canaries). This past week, [Tristan found](https://twitter.com/#!/tristanwayne/status/48870080670470144) a copy of our first and last recording at the Value Village near Queen and Logan. I&#8217;m not quite sure how this correlates to fame and fortune.
