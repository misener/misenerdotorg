We&#8217;ve [known for a while](http://misener.org/archives/140) that the new 5G iPods support high quality voice recordings, but up until now there&#8217;s not been a way to actually make recordings.

All that changed today, when Griffin announced the [iTalkPro](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/griffin-debuts-italkpro-stereo-microphone-for-5g-ipods/).

It&#8217;s powered by the iPod, has built-in mics, software gain controls, and can record CD quality stereo sound. No word on whether you can hook up an external mic or monitor while recording. This probably won&#8217;t replace your pro flash recorder, but if you carry an iPod around already, it might be a nice accessory to bring along.
