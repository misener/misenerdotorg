Back in June 2007, I got an email from [Nora Young](http://www.norayoung.ca/). The subject line read:

> that tech show

At the time, I knew Nora had been working on a pitch for a show called [Spark](http://cbc.ca/spark/). I&#8217;d heard the pilots, and they sounded great. But in June 2007, when I first got Nora&#8217;s message, I had no idea that I&#8217;d end up spending the next four and a half years of my working life on &#8220;that tech show.&#8221;

Working on Spark has been one of the most rewarding things I&#8217;ve done in my time at CBC Radio. Every day, I work alongside a small team of really talented people, making the kind of show _I&#8217;d_ want to listen to (I mean, seriously, what other show would let me dedicate the majority of a broadcast to an [in-depth look at the history of QWERTY](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2009/05/episode-77-may-13-16-2009/)?). I count myself very, _very_ lucky. Sometimes people ask me what I do for living, and I tell them, &#8220;I call up smart, interesting people, talk to them, and put them on the radio.&#8221; Sure beats any other job I&#8217;ve ever had.

Which is why today is bittersweet.

Today is my last day working at Spark for at least for a year. And even though I&#8217;m leaving for a [pretty awesome year-long adventure in France](http://misener.org/archives/1088 ".ca -> .fr"), I&#8217;d be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t a little bit misty-eyed. I&#8217;m going to miss it all: the story meetings, recording interviews, slicing and dicing tape in Pro Tools, and interacting with &#8220;the broader Spark community.&#8221; But more than anything, I&#8217;m going to miss Nora and the whole team who work so hard to put Spark together every week.

Spark, when it works &#8212; when it really, really nails it &#8212; is a show about _what&#8217;s next_. It&#8217;s a forward-looking show made by forward-looking people. So yes, I&#8217;m sad to be leaving. But at the same time, I can&#8217;t wait to hear what Spark comes up with next.

I&#8217;ll be listening.
