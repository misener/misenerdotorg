Here it is, folks: the official CMG online news magazine. It&#8217;s called [CBC On the Line](http://cbcontheline.ca/), and it&#8217;s looking for submissions. Sadly, no RSS (yet).

And, earlier today outside the broadcast centre in Toronto, there was talk of getting a morning show podcast off the ground from the University of Toronto&#8217;s [CIUT](http://www.ciut.fm/) studios. As far as I understand, they&#8217;re talking 2 hours of daily &#8220;business as usual&#8221; local programming, slated to begin early next week.
