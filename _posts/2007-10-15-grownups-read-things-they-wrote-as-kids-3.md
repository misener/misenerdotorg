Last night, at Future Bakery, I ran into Bryanna, who read at the first [Grownups&#8230; reading night](http://misener.org/read/) back in February. Seeing her reminded me that there hasn&#8217;t been an event since the spring. Which is a shame, because it&#8217;s fun.

So today I called up Blake at the Victory, and I&#8217;m pleased to announce:

**What:** Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids 3

**When:** Monday, November 19, 2007 at 8:00 pm

**Where:** [The Victory Cafe](http://www.victorycafe.ca/), 581 Markham Street, Toronto

So start digging through your parents&#8217; basement.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> there&#8217;s a [FaceBook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=19485458440) now.
