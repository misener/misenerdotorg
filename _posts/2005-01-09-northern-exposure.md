After reading [The Lowedown](http://www.thecoast.ns.ca/thelowedown.html) in this week&#8217;s [Coast](http://www.thecoast.ns.ca/index.html), I listened to the first two episodes of Doug Gordon&#8217;s [New Audio Showroom](http://wpr.org/announce/newaudioshowroom.cfm). Particularly liked the &#8220;This Canadian Existence&#8221; show. You can listen to all three shows online in RealAudio.

And speaking of RealAudio, I&#8217;ve gotten rid of RealPlayer, and am now listening using [Real Alternative](http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Real_Alternative.htm).
