I must admit that itâ€™s a strange thing to go to bed before itâ€™s dark out. Itâ€™s weird to set your clock radio to go off at 3:00 AM.

But thatâ€™s what I did last night. And what Iâ€™ll do for a number of weeks this summer. Today was my first early shift at CBE, and I drove to work on my bike in the dark. There arenâ€™t many people on Windsorâ€™s roads at 3:50 in the morning. Still, I plan on buying some headlamps for my bicycle.

In other news, this is my eleventh day of taking cold showers. The natural gas hasnâ€™t been hooked up at the place Iâ€™m staying, so the water heater doesnâ€™t work. Brrr.
