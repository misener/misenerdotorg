I&#8217;m back at the Broadcast Centre for a little while, filling in at Radio Syndication. On my way out today, I ran into a colleague who&#8217;s working for CBC Radio One&#8217;s new [Sirius channel](http://www.cbc.ca/sirius/).

I don&#8217;t have a satellite radio, so I haven&#8217;t yet heard the channel. But apparently, it&#8217;s mainly repurposed Radio One content, minus any local information. This, of course, leaves gaps to fill. So what do you fill it with?

I immediately thought of American Public Media&#8217;s [Sonic ID](http://www.atlantic.org/cainan/sonicid/) project. Basically, a Sonic ID is an extended station ID:

> short portraits and stories that weave the broadcast day of WCAI/NAN/ZAI with the voices, sounds and stories of our region.

They run a minute or two apiece, and are a good way of getting new and different voices on the air. I don&#8217;t know why CBC doesn&#8217;t commission a ton of these at the local, regional, and national levels. They&#8217;d be great. And for filling some of the gaps on Sirius, they&#8217;d be perfect.

I produced three Sonic IDs for [CKDU](http://www.ckdu.ca/) a couple of years ago. Have a listen to the IDs on APM&#8217;s site, and if you want more, listen to mine:

  * [Carol on thong underwear](http://libsyn.com/media/collective/Burton.mp3) (my favourite)
  * [Frank on planting a red maple tree](http://libsyn.com/media/collective/Rostek.mp3)
  * [Shawn on cutting the eyes off fruit flies](http://libsyn.com/media/collective/Slaunwhite.mp3)
