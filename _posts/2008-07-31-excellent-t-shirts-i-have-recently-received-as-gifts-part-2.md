Knowing my affinity for mesh networking, Tristan had this shirt made for me as a birthday gift this year.

**Fun fact:** Tristan had this shirt made at [LogoMagik](http://www.logomagik.com/) across the street from me. A few months ago, when I emailed LogoMagik to see if they were interesting in joining [my mesh network thing](http://public.meraki.com/network/Corktown), they didn&#8217;t reply.
