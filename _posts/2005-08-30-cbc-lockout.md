In the [Halifax Daily News](http://www.hfxnews.com/) this morning, I read about another CMG-campus/community radio collaboration. [CBC Lockout](http://cbclockout.org/) says: 

> Find out which songs Don Connolly, Costas Halavrezos and Carmen Klassen hum on the picket line. Radio reporter Laura Graham hosts the Soundtrack of Our (Locked-out) Lives every Tuesday from 2:30-3:30 on [CKDU](http://www.ckdu.ca), 97.5 FM.

Should make for some good listening on the line. If you don&#8217;t live within the CKDU broadcast range, you can always [listen online.](http://ckdu.ca/faq.html#4)
