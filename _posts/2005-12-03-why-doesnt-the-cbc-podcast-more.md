Over at Dose Magazine, Hugh has written an excellent article on the [CBC and its podcasting strategy](http://dosemagazine.blogsome.com/2005/11/30/cbc-some-lengthy-rambling/). It seems to be based mostly on conversation with Tod Maffin on his [cross-country podcasting tour](http://todmaffin.com/podcasting/), and is especially good at explaining some of the reasons why the corporation doesn&#8217;t do more podcasting.

Not surprisingly, the main reasons aren&#8217;t technical.
