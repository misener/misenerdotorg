One more reason not to talk to strangers, at least on Facebook. They&#8217;re launching a new feature called [social authentication](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=486790652130), and if your friends list is full of people you don&#8217;t actually know, you could be locked out of your account:

> Instead of showing you a traditional captcha on Facebook, one of the ways we may help verify your identity is through social authentication. We will show you a few pictures of your friends and ask you to name the person in those photos. Hackers halfway across the world might know your password, but they don&#8217;t know who your friends are.

The problem with this, of course, is that if you may not know who your friends are, either. +1 for [my new favourite Gmail filter](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmisener/5166975563/).
