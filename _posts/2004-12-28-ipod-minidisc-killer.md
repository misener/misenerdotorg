Via iPoding &#8212; [iPod-Linux Installer 0.3a Released](http://www.ipoding.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2053).

According the [manual](http://www.ipodlinux.org/index.php/Manual#How_Do_I_record.3F), &#8220;Podzilla now supports Voice Recording for the 3rd Generation iPods (Dock connector + touch wheel).&#8221; This in and of itself isn&#8217;t all that exciting, but when you read on &#8212; &#8220;The format for recording is 44.1 kHz uncompressed RAW.&#8221;

Wow! That sure is better than the 8kHz, 16 bit mono files that the Apple firmware limits you to. The iPod community has known for a long time that the device is capable of much higher-quality recordings:

> Before Apple released new firmware and Belkin released the Voice Recorder, much was made of the 3G iPod&#8217;s technical capabilities for audio recording. On paper, the 3G iPod could actually sample audio at CD-quality rates (thanks to Wolfson&#8217;s older 8731 chip) and record it in MP3 format (thanks to PortalPlayer&#8217;s earlier 5002 chip). But when Apple released new firmware, the iPod was limited to sampling audio at unimpressive, voice only-quality rates, and recording in uncompressed WAV format. 

The Linux on iPod featureset isn&#8217;t 100% yet, but this does indeed look promising. I&#8217;d love to carry around a single, all-digital recording solution with virtually unlimited capacity.

Update: Just read Jordan Carter&#8217;s [review](http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/feedback/linux_on_ipod/Linux_on_ipod_review.html) of Linux on the iPod, and he calls the recording capability &#8220;a remarkable feature, unfortunately limited only to 3G iPods. A friend with Linux on his 3G demonstrated this to me &#8211; and it&#8217;s mind-blowing.&#8221;
