So a year ago, [Tristan](http://tristanhomer.blogspot.com/) and I made thirty episodes of a video podcast called [Jim Dupree: Enthusiast](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=148D2563FCC4A745). It was reasonably well-received, so we stopped doing it.

Now it turns out that videoblogger extraordinaire [Steve Garfield](http://www.stevegarfield.com/) is a curator at The American Film Institute&#8217;s [Pixelodeon](http://pixelodeonfest.com/) festival in Los Angeles this year. And he&#8217;s included [Jim Dupree: HDTV enthusiast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycsW2kSe9Qs) as part of his collection, [I Watched, I Laughed, I Vlogged](http://pixelodeonfest.com/schedule/#garfield). So not only will our ridiculous video be shown on a big screen, but I also get to use this official-looking badge:

So if you happen to be in LA on Sunday, June 10, consider checking out the big show.
