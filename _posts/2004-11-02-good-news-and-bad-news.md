_The Bad_: Yesterday I took my tape recorder ([Sony TCM-5000EV](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006J08Q?v=glance)) to an electronics repair shop, and they basically told me that it was irreparable. There is some sort of weird hiss coming through the speaker and headphone jack whenever the motor is engaged. Back in Sackville, when I took it to Munroe&#8217;s TV repair, Jim told me that he knew what was wrong with it &#8212; a filter problem. These electronic hotshots in Toronto think I&#8217;m plum out of luck. Perhaps I&#8217;ll bring it back to Sackville with me.
