_Memento_ is a show idea I pitched to the CBC Radio Program Development Group earlier this year. Though they didn&#8217;t want it, I decided to produce a pilot as my senior practicum project for Ryerson.

I finally got around to uploading the pilot to [PRX.org](http://www.prx.org/).

It&#8217;s not 100% yet &#8212; there&#8217;s still tweaking I&#8217;d like (and plan) to do. But in the meantime, please [have a listen](http://www.prx.org/piece/4854) and let me know what you think.
