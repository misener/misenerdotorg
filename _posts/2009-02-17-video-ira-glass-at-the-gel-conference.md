It&#8217;s about surprise and humour. It&#8217;s a bit of Storytelling 101 (event leads to event leads to event leads to universal truth). But it&#8217;s mostly about craft, and if you tell stories, it&#8217;s totally worth 32 minutes of your time. From 2007, here&#8217;s [Ira Glass at the Gel Conference](http://gelconference.com/videos/2007/ira_glass/):

Present again is Ira&#8217;s [familiar](http://misener.org/archives/307) &#8220;taking the tools of journalism and applying them to people whom you wouldnâ€™t normally apply them to&#8221; mantra.

Particularly interesting is the explanation for why TAL doesn&#8217;t have billboards (or &#8220;bills&#8221;):

> One of the differences between our show and the other shows on the public radio is that the other shows will start their show with a list of what&#8217;s coming up on the program, which I feel is a sort of singularly uninteresting way to start something. Actually, on our show we would just start the action going. Like, I feel that if we could draw you into the dream of it, you&#8217;ll be inside it before you can even think about why you&#8217;re inside it or what it is. And it&#8217;s far more irresistible.

You can watch the whole video at the [Gel site](http://gelconference.com/videos/2007/ira_glass/), or if you&#8217;re feeling thieve-y, you can just [download the FLV file](http://gelvideos.com/flv/ira-glass.flv).
