Hilary Green isn&#8217;t just hungry. She&#8217;s hungry hungry. And speaking from experience, she&#8217;s a good cook, too. Her new-ish blog, [Hungry Hungry Hilly](http://hungryhungryhilly.blogspot.com/) was started

> mainly (though not entirely) [&#8230;] after I had a falling out with blogTO about my photos for the restaurant reviews I was posting.

If you live in our neck of the woods, check it out for the restaurant [reviews](http://hungryhungryhilly.blogspot.com/search/label/resturants).

If you don&#8217;t, check it out for the [recipes](http://hungryhungryhilly.blogspot.com/search/label/recipes).
