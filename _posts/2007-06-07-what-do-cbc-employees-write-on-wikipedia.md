If your website has ever been visited by someone inside the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, [intout.cbc.ca](http://intout.cbc.ca) probably shows up in your traffic records. intout.cbc.ca is the public face of the entire corporation (online, anyway), and it resolves to [159.33.10.92](http://ws.arin.net/cgi-bin/whois.pl?queryinput=159.33.10.92).

One neat thing about this is that you take a look at the [Wikipedia user contributions for 159.33.10.92](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=159.33.10.92) to find out what CBC employees are writing about. Its seems that a popular topic is the CBC itself:

  * 21:36, 4 May 2007 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation&action=history "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation&diff=prev&oldid=128299485 "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation")) [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation") ([â†’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation#Nicknames "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation")Nicknames)
  * 19:04, 2 May 2007 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_WireTap_episodes&action=history "List of WireTap episodes")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_WireTap_episodes&diff=prev&oldid=127752458 "List of WireTap episodes")) [List of WireTap episodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WireTap_episodes "List of WireTap episodes") ([â†’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WireTap_episodes#Season_2 "List of WireTap episodes")Season 2)
  * 20:09, 21 March 2007 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shauna_MacDonald&action=history "Shauna MacDonald")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shauna_MacDonald&diff=prev&oldid=116858509 "Shauna MacDonald")) [Shauna MacDonald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shauna_MacDonald "Shauna MacDonald")
  * 21:00, 12 December 2006 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heather_Hiscox&action=history "Heather Hiscox")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heather_Hiscox&diff=prev&oldid=93895533 "Heather Hiscox")) [Heather Hiscox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Hiscox "Heather Hiscox")
  * 18:21, 10 November 2006 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Barrie&action=history "Andy Barrie")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Barrie&diff=prev&oldid=86979466 "Andy Barrie")) [Andy Barrie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Barrie "Andy Barrie")

And apparently someone at the corporation has a hate-on for Jacob Hoggard:

  * 20:06, 28 February 2007 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Hoggard&action=history "Jacob Hoggard")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jacob_Hoggard&diff=prev&oldid=111648745 "Jacob Hoggard")) [Jacob Hoggard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Hoggard "Jacob Hoggard")
  * 21:20, 7 February 2007 ([hist](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hedley_%28band%29&action=history "Hedley (band)")) ([diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hedley_%28band%29&diff=prev&oldid=106405693 "Hedley (band)")) [Hedley (band)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedley_%28band%29 "Hedley (band)") ([â†’](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedley_%28band%29#Trivia "Hedley (band)")Trivia)

Since everyone has the same IP address inside the CBC, it&#8217;s impossible to know who wrote what. Check out the [full list of edits](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=159.33.10.92). Fascinating reading.
