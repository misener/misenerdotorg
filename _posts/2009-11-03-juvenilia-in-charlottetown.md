Every once in a while, I get an email or a telephone call along the lines of &#8220;I really like the idea behind [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com). Can I do one in my city?&#8221;

My response is almost always, &#8220;Of course! Please do! Just call it something else.&#8221;

So then, from Sandy Nicholson: a GRTTWaK-inspired night of juvenilia in Charlottetown called **The Hilroy Diaries** ([Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=176224696864)). Note that unlike GRTTWaK, there _is_ a cover charge, but it goes to a not-for-profit called [Women&#8217;s Network PEI](http://wnpei.org/aboutwn.html). Here&#8217;s the poster:
