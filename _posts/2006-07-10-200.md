Last fall, I joined a rock and roll band. We call ourselves [The Canaries](http://www.thecanaries.ca). And I&#8217;m proud to say that we&#8217;re playing our very first show. In case it didn&#8217;t arrive in your inbox, here&#8217;s the email:

**THE CANARIES
  
LIVE AT CLINTON&#8217;S
  
THURSDAY, JULY 20TH**

Frank Sinclair, Mike Zikovitz and Dean Pomeroy (formerly of The Plastic Folk) are back with a new band, a new name, new songs and a new member, bassist Dan Misener.

So come by Clinton&#8217;s on July 20th at 9:00 to see The Canaries&#8217; Toronto debut.
