From [Blogcritics.org: One Man&#8217;s Opinion on the CBC Strike](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/08/15/190424.php)

> What I can&#8217;t accept from the CBC, though, is the massive push towards temp work. About a third of the CBC workforce right now consists of temps and contract workers. The CBC needs its full-time employees, and while it needs to be efficient it also needs to be the public network it has been since its inception. It&#8217;s ridiculous to turn the CBC radio and television networks into a carbon copy of what&#8217;s already out there.
