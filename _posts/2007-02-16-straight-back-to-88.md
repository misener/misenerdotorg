Just in time for my poorly named evening of reading ([Adults Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://misener.org/archives/232)), a package from my Mom arrived in the mail:

Inside, I found five scribblers.* They were all journals from elementary school at [Sackville Centennial](http://www.sces.ednet.ns.ca/). There&#8217;s some great stuff inside, and I&#8217;m looking forward to reading from these on Monday. Too bad I don&#8217;t have an overhead projector, because there are some great illustrations inside.

Thanks, Mom!
