[Rhiannon](http://www.livejournal.com/users/apt_rhiannon/32120.html) brings up an excellent point. On its main site, [CBC.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/), the corporation has posted this notice:

> _CBC is currently experiencing a labour disruption. Click [here](http://cbcnegotiations.ca/) to go to the official CBC negotiations site._

The link takes you to the CBC-run [cbcnegotiations.ca](http://cbcnegotiations.ca/). And, as Rhiannon points out, &#8220;since the CBC is the employer in this situation, it&#8217;s all one sided.&#8221;

Looking for some balance? I couldn&#8217;t find a single link to the [Canadian Media Guild](http://www.cmg.ca) on cbcnegotiations.ca. Nor is there an &#8220;external link&#8221; on the [CBC&#8217;s coverage](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/08/14/CBC_locks_out_employees20050815.html) of the lockout.

Obviously, the corporation has a vested interest in presenting its side of the story. But even during the lockout, shouldn&#8217;t the CBC provide _both_ sides? Isn&#8217;t that what [journalistic balance](http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/accountability/journalistic/balance.shtml) is all about?
