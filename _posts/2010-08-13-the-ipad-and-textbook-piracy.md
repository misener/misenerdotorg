[CourseSmart](http://www.coursesmart.com/go/mobile/) has been [all](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/08/coursesmart-launches-e-textbooks-for-ipad/) [over](http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/08/13/coursesmart-for-ipad-free-app-with-90-percent-of-core-textbooks-available/) [the tech blogs](http://futuretense.publicradio.org/blog/index.php?id=947576499) today, with its new iPad app and claims that its catalog contains 90% of “core textbooks.” I definitely understand the appeal of storing and using textbooks on a tablet device: no books to carry around or forget at home. Everything&#8217;s there on one device, complete with bookmarks and annotations.

But here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m really wondering: aside from legit textbook sources like CourseSmart, how will the new breed of tablet computers affect [ebook piracy](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2009/11/full-interview-gabriella-coleman-on-digital-book-piracy/)? There&#8217;s certainly no shortage of textbooks on Bittorrent sites, Usenet indexes, and Gigapedia.
