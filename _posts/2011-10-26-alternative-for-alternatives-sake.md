Back in the early part of the last decade, when I was studying at Dalhousie and King&#8217;s, I spent a big chunk of my time at the small but mighty [CKDU](http://ckdu.ca/), our (then) 50-watt campus/community radio station.

My time there was, in a word, **formational**. I knew I wanted to make radio, but the thing was, I had absolutely no idea _how_. Radio was this thing that I loved &#8212; something I knew I wanted to be a part of &#8212; but its inner workings were still very much a mystery to me.

At CKDU, I met a ton of really smart, talented people who helped me learn. They showed me how to cut tape, and use a mixing board, and speak into a microphone without popping my Ps. They turned me onto new music, and new radio shows, and new people. They let me host the weekly countdown show (which came with the perk of having my name published in The Coast every week!). They let me experiment on the radio, making my own silly little _This American Life_ rip-off show.

Though I&#8217;m no longer actively involved in campus/community radio, I still believe strongly in its mission. CKDU&#8217;s was (and still is):

> to act as an alternative to public (CBC) and commercial radio stations. We offer programming that can not be found elsewhere on the airwaves in Halifax.

Why mention this? This week, Ryerson University (my alma mater and yes, current employer) held a referendum on creating a new campus radio station, to replace the now-defunct CKLN. [The students overwhelmingly voted yes](http://www.rsuonline.ca/index.php?section_id=47&content_id=952).

Congratulations to everyone who wanted this thing. Can&#8217;t wait to tune in.
