My password is bigger than your password. And that&#8217;s a good thing.

[According to researchers at Georgia Tech](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10963967), GPU-accelerated brute-force password cracking techiques are getting _really_ good:

> &#8220;Right now we can confidently say that a seven-character password is hopelessly inadequate,&#8221; said Mr [Richard] Boyd, &#8220;and as GPU power continues to go up every year, the threat will increase.&#8221;

Instead, Boyd recommends &#8220;a 12-character combination of upper and lower case letters, symbols and digits.&#8221;

That&#8217;s good advice. But alas, we live in a world where [75% of the population uses the exact same password for their email and social networking accounts](http://www.malwarecity.com/blog/the-limits-of-privacy-is-this-your-password-865.html), and the [5 most popular passwords](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/imperva-rockyou-most-common-passwords,9486.html) go like this:

  1. 123456
  2. 12345
  3. 123456789
  4. Password
  5. iloveyou

Personally, I use [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password)[1. There are many other tools that do this. See: RoboForm, KeePass, MyPasswordSafe, Password Agent, Password Safe, Sxipper, Passpack, TurboPasswords, etc.] to generate and manage strong passwords, and I love it. I have to say, there&#8217;s a special warm, fuzzy, geeky feeling that goes along with knowing you&#8217;re using good passwords. It&#8217;s not unlike the feeling I get when I know my family photos are redundantly backed up.

My next CBC tech column (Tuesday on CBC R1 afternoon shows across Canada) is all about generating good passwords. It&#8217;s good advice to hear anytime, but if you use the same password for more than one site, **seriously, change it now**.
