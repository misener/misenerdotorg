I recently came upon [Meryl&#8217;s LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/users/merylinabarrel/) while looking around for Jonathan Goldstein/WireTap-related stuff. From what I can gather, Meryl has a huge crush on her English prof. This crush somehow led to an interview on WireTap.

Anyhow, I&#8217;ve been reading her posts lately. She&#8217;s a big This American Life fan, and recently visited Chicago. Unbeknownst to Meryl, her pal Colin got them into a live TAL taping, and she met Ira Glass.

Her post detailing the experience is excellent. [Read it](http://www.livejournal.com/users/merylinabarrel/76963.html).
