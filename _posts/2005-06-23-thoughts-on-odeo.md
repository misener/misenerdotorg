Last night, I requested an invite to [Odeo](http://www.odeo.com), Noah Glass and Evan Williams&#8217;s new podcasting portal. Shortly after, I received an invitation, and signed up. Odeo claims to offer its users a podcasting holy trinity: &#8220;Listen, Sync, Create.&#8221;

On the &#8220;Listen&#8221; level, Odeo is a user-friendly podcast directory. It&#8217;s got some nice features: tagging (a la [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com)), audio previews and individual Odeo RSS feeds for each podcast, comments, and personalized subscription lists and queues. I was able to browse podcasts, listen to samples, view past episodes (or &#8220;Shows,&#8221; as Odeo calls them), and add feeds and shows to my subscription list and queue.

To actually get content onto my iPod, I had to download the OdeoSyncr. As a podcatching app, the Mac version is pretty bare-bones. There&#8217;s a big pink &#8220;Sync Now&#8221; button, and a link to an online settings page. Simple as it was, it performed its stated functions; it connected to Odeo, got a list of my feeds, and downloaded them into iTunes. The About page states that the program is based on iPodder, feedparser, and BitTorrent technology. Downloads seemed a bit slow, so perhaps this client is using some sort of distributed peer-to-peer network to alleviate server strain?

Additionally, it would be nice if OdeoSyncr could add ID3 info to content before putting it in iTunes (like iPodderX does). Then I could use my existing iTunes smart playlists to filter content.

The &#8220;Create&#8221; section of the site isn&#8217;t up and running yet. The page says &#8220;We&#8217;re not ready to open the doors on the Create side of Odeo&#8217;s &#8220;Listen, Sync, Create&#8221; just yet, because we want to make sure everything&#8217;s working well and can handle the demand.&#8221;

But, I successfully added [Metro Morning&#8217;s podcast](http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/metromorning.xml) to the [directory](http://www.odeo.com/channel/3889/view/), and was able to download content. Frustratingly, only one of the four daily items (the oldest) was automatically added to my download queue.

All-in-all, Odeo&#8217;s not there yet. Promising, though. Then again, if Apple can build some sort of magical tagging system into its podcasting support for iTunes, I&#8217;ll have no use for Odeo.
