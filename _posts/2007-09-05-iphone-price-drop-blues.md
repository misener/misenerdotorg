Late last month, I picked up an 8-gig iPhone from the Apple Store at Somerset Mall in Troy, Michigan. Though I can&#8217;t unlock it for use with Fido yet, it&#8217;s still a pretty great iPod and portable email/web device, and I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting a full software unlock.

Today, in addition to announcing a new family of iPods, Steve Jobs announced a price drop on the 8-gig iPhone. From $599 to $399 USD. That&#8217;s a pretty big drop, especially for a product that&#8217;s only been out for two months.

So-called &#8220;early adopters&#8221; are [pretty peeved](http://technorati.com/posts/tag/iphone+price) about this.

[TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/05/apple-screwed-you-so-now-what/) and [CrunchGear](http://crunchgear.com/2007/09/05/crunchdeals-iphone-owners-can-get-a-refund/#more-12604) both have some suggestions for upset iPhone owners.

Luckily, I bought my iPhone on August 25. And according to the back of my receipt:

> Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product withing fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of purchase, you may request a refund of the difference between the price paid and the current selling price.

I plan to call the Apple Store tomorrow to request my refund. Not sure how it&#8217;ll work since I&#8217;m in Toronto. I&#8217;ll post the details here when I find out.

He told me that I could probably bring the iPhone into the Apple Store at the Eaton Centre. When I called the Eaton Centre store, they told me they &#8220;don&#8217;t do cross-border refunds.&#8221; So I called the Somerset store back. Charlie took down my name and phone numbers, and told me that someone would get back to me tonight or tomorrow. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.

In the meantime, Steve Jobs [offered refund-ineligible iPhone customers at $100 credit](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/09/06/sorry_says_jobs_in_open_letter_to_early_iphone_buyers_will_100_do.html).

**Update 2:** Nobody from the Apple Store got back to me, so I called again and talked to manager Ryan. Within two hours, he sent me an email with a PDF receipt (right) for the credit. Thanks Ryan!
