One year ago, I decided to take my iPhone data-only. No voice plan. No texting plan. Just sweet, sweet data.

I don&#8217;t like paying for things that I don&#8217;t use, and I rarely use the telephone part of my iPhone. That is, I don&#8217;t make many voice calls over the cell network. So I figured I could save some money.

I looked around for data-only smartphone plans in Canada, but couldn&#8217;t find any. The carriers don&#8217;t seem to offer data without voice.

However, there&#8217;s an exception: tablets.

Most of the big carriers are happy to sell data-only plans for use with a data-only device, like a tablet, hotspot, or wireless modem. But can you sign up for a data-only plan intended for a tablet and use it with a smartphone?

**Yes.** And that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past year. I use a month-to-month [tablet Flex plan](http://www.bell.ca/Mobility/Cell_phone_plans/iPad_data_plans/Flex_plan.tab) from Bell with my iPhone 5. Most months, I pay ~$40/month (tax in) for 5GB of data, and that suits me just fine.

Sound good? Here&#8217;s how I got it all set up, and some of the workarounds I&#8217;ve found that make living data-only a little easier:

## Getting a SIM card

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1676" alt="Bell Nano SIM" src="http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3193-5-528x352.jpg" width="528" height="352" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3193-5-528x352.jpg 528w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3193-5-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" />

To pull this off, I first needed a Nano SIM card for my iPhone. [Bell sells Nano SIMs off-contract for $10](http://www.bell.ca/Mobility/Products/4G-LTE-Nano-SIM-card), but I&#8217;d heard that if you ask nicely, the Apple store gives them away for free.

Sure enough, when I visited my local Apple store and asked for a Bell Nano SIM, they gave me one. I didn&#8217;t have to sign up for a contract in-store, or provide any personal information. Easy.

## Setting up a new account

To sign up for Bell&#8217;s tablet flex plan, I had to set up a new account. Honestly, I would have preferred a prepaid option, but the flex plan (with its desirable tiered pricing) was only available on a post-paid, month-to-month basis.

Setting up a new account was simple. I telephoned Bell (on Jenna&#8217;s phone), asked for the tablet Flex plan, and read them the [ICCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICCID#ICCID) from my newly aquired Nano SIM.

Because Bell was running a promotion at the time, they waived the usual $35 setup fee, and offered me &#8220;worry-free&#8221; (no overages) data for $5/month for the first two months. Bonus.

Shortly after hanging up with Bell, I popped the Nano SIM into my iPhone, and was happy to see that everything worked with zero on-device configuration. Nice.

**A side note:** despite signing up for a data-only plan, my Bell Nano SIM does have a Toronto-area 647 phone number associated with it. I _can_ place and receive calls, and send texts to and from this number. But I don&#8217;t, because calls and texts are billed by Bell at high rates ($0.40/min and $0.20/text in 2013), and I have better, cheaper workarounds (see below). That said, it&#8217;s nice to know that in an emergency, I _could_ make a good old-fashioned telephone call.

# Speedy data

In my everyday use, Bell&#8217;s LTE is fast. This is typical:

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1678" alt="Speedtest" src="http://misener.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_4239-2-528x243.png" width="528" height="243" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_4239-2-528x243.png 528w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_4239-2.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" />

Bell&#8217;s top flex plan tier gives me up to 5GB/month &#8212; way more than I&#8217;ve ever actually used (outside of the first two &#8220;unlimited&#8221; months, when I went crazy). Data costs $10/GB if I ever go over.

Yes, tethering works just fine, with no additional charges. This is especially handy when Via Rail&#8217;s on-board WiFi just isn&#8217;t cutting it.

# Workarounds: Voice Calls

Like I said, I _could_ make calls over the Bell network, using the number associated with my SIM. But that would defeat the purpose of going data-only, wouldn&#8217;t it? Instead, I make voice calls from my iPhone using a handful of alternatives.

For calling &#8220;regular&#8221; phones, I use [Acrobits Softphone for iOS](http://www.acrobits.cz/4/acrobits-softphone-for-iphone), configured to use a SIP account through [VoIP.ms](http://voip.ms/). I ported my local Toronto phone number to VoIP.ms in late 2011, and haven&#8217;t looked back since. This SIP setup lets me place and receive voice calls easily, and _never_ uses Bell&#8217;s voice network.

I also have a Google Voice account, which I sometimes use for longer outgoing calls. Google&#8217;s [Hangouts app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/hangouts/id643496868) lets me dial regular phone numbers directly.

Finally, for calling other iPhone owners, I use [Facetime Audio](http://support.apple.com/kb/TI189). It&#8217;s baked into iOS at the system level, the audio quality is very good, and it works well on both WiFi and cell data networks. I agree that [Facetime Audio is Apple&#8217;s biggest little feature addition in iOS 7](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/23/facetime-audio-is-apples-biggest-little-feature-addition-in-ios-7/), and I look forward to its [debut on the Mac in 10.9.2](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/19/apple-adds-facetime-audio-to-os-x-10-9-2-beta-bringing-native-mac-to-ios-voice-calls-closer/).

**A small Facetime Audio wrinkle:** Since Facetime on the iPhone is associated with your iPhone&#8217;s telephone number, and since my iPhone has a Bell-issued number that I don&#8217;t use (and don&#8217;t want anyone to know about), it&#8217;s important that I set my Facetime Caller ID to something other than that &#8220;secret&#8221; number. I use my email address instead.

I know this sounds overly complicated. Believe me, it&#8217;s not. Like I said, I don&#8217;t make a lot of voice calls on my iPhone, and for anyone who dials me, my phone number is the same as it&#8217;s been for years.

# Workarounds: Texting

iMessage has almost completely replaced texting for me. All data, all the time.

When I need to text someone who&#8217;s not on an iPhone, I use the Google Voice iOS app, and make sure to preface my message with &#8220;It&#8217;s Dan,&#8221; because my Google Voice number is US-based.

**A texting wrinkle:** Weird things happen when people text my local Toronto (416) number. Because my SIP provider doesn&#8217;t support incoming SMS messages, texts often turn into voicemail messages featuring a text-to-speech robot. In the future, I may switch away from VoIP.ms to another SIP provider that supports SMS, like [Anveo](http://anveo.com/sms).

# Conclusion

It took a bit of work to get set up, but a year in, living data-only works well, and saves me money.

My ideal wireless carrier would act like a dumb data pipe, and let me pick and choose the services I run on top of it. With a data-only tablet plan, I get as close to that as possible.

As always, your mileage may vary.
