If you&#8217;re a fan of [This American Life](http://www.thislife.org), if you&#8217;re an [Ira Glass fanboy](http://heywriterboy.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-i-heart-ira-glass.html), or if you&#8217;re generally a [radio geek](http://www.todmaffin.com), you **need** to read [Meryl&#8217;s blog post](http://merylinabarrel.livejournal.com/187724.html) about seeing Ira and David Rakoff at the Ohio Theater.

It&#8217;s a wonderfully told account, with some great moments:

> Ira and David both said that a lot of times they&#8217;d get to the very end of a story and stop and say, &#8220;So what does this actually mean?&#8221; and that a lot of stories get thrown out at that point because they don&#8217;t seem to have any larger implications. He said that some stories have really strong themes and it&#8217;s clear the whole way through what they&#8217;re about, but others have to be shaped at the last minute. &#8220;It&#8217;s always that last paragraph where we scramble for some false epiphany,&#8221; Ira said. &#8220;And then you add music to make it seem like a real epiphany,&#8221; David added.

But the best part is how afterwards, during the book signing, Ira starts giving her story advice (Meryl is a journalism student), and she pulls out her recorder and starts taping him.

Seriously. [Check it out](http://merylinabarrel.livejournal.com/187724.html). You&#8217;ll be jealous.
