Today, [Flipboard added audio playback controls and a new Audio category to its app](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/05/16/flipboard-launches-new-audio-category-section/):

> The section is searchable but comes with recommended SoundCloud users, as well as popular shows from [NPR](http://www.npr.org/) (National Public Radio) and [PRI](http://www.pri.org/) (Public Radio International).

I&#8217;ve played with the new Flipboard for a while, and it&#8217;s yet another example of why  [segmentation matters](http://misener.org/archives/980 "Segmentation matters"), and how for public radio, [the atomic element is the story](http://misener.org/archives/1038 "“The atomic element is the story”").

Radio networks and shows that split their programming up into sharable, spreadable component parts are reaping the rewards of new platforms. And it&#8217;s not just Flipboard.

  * [Audiofiles](http://audiofil.es/) is a web-based sharing and discovery platform for radio, sorting stories based on mood, type, length, producer, and source.
  * [NPR&#8217;s Infinite Player](http://www.npr.org/sandbox/conplay/) is like Pandora for public radio, playing a customized stream of stories that listeners can fine-tune as they listen.
  * [The Super Times](http://thesupertimes.com/) is a forthcoming iPhone app that assembles a personalized audio magazine of &#8220;the best audio stories from around the web.&#8221;

All of these platforms rely on content being broken up into its component parts. _Segmentation is a prerequisite_.

As of late 2011, [Flipboard had 5 million users](http://mashable.com/2011/12/14/flipboard-iphone-1-million/). That&#8217;s the opportunity here &#8212; to reach millions of potential new listeners, inside an app they already know and use.

So then, for radio programmers: even if you have the best content in the entire world, if you don&#8217;t split it up into easily sharable pieces, you&#8217;ll miss out on a whole new wave of new consumption technologies. I&#8217;m looking at you, CBC Radio.

Get out your scissors. Quickly.
