I play Jim Dupree, a man who is enthusiastic about many things. In the first episode, released this week, Jim is enthusiastic about dogs. Glenn, the interviewer, questions Jim about his enthusiasm.

It&#8217;s a video podcast, so you might want to use the new [iTunes](http://www.apple.ca/itunes/) to subscribe. You can subscribe from the [Jim Dupree: Enthusiast page](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=83236843&s=143455) in the iTunes podcast directory, or copy the following URL into your podcatcher:
