I wrote about this a while back, but it seems that [Digidesign has finally updated Pro Tools for Leopard](http://www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?langid=100&navid=48&itemid=32890&action=news_details&ref=p):

> Digidesign is pleased to announce the availability of Pro Tools® 7.4.2 software, which provides Mac OS X 10.5.3* (Leopard) compatibility to Pro Tools|HD®, Pro Tools LE®, and Pro Tools M-Powered™ users. We’d like to thank our entire community of Mac users for their patience as we worked to bring a fully tested and reliable version of Pro Tools to Apple’s latest platform.
