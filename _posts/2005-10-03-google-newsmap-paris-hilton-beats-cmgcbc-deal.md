Curious to know how much attention other media are paying to the CBC/CMG deal, I checked Marumishi&#8217;s [Google Newsmap](http://www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/newsmap.cfm?layout=0&selected=ca&categories=world,nation,business,technology,sports,entertainment,health), which visually displays the popularity of news stories on Google News.

As of 9:15 this morning, Google News&#8217;s algorithms hadn&#8217;t categorized the story as national news. Nor as business news. Nope. You&#8217;ll find it under [entertainment](http://news.google.ca/?ned=ca&topic=e). And it seems that way more news outlets are paying attention to Paris Hilton and Tara Reid.

Just goes to show that a story&#8217;s importance can be highly relative.
