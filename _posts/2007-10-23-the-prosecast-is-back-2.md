Good news, lovers of books.

Cathi Bond (one half of [The Sniffer](http://www.foursevens.com/thesniffer/)) and her [Prosecast](http://www.foursevens.com/prosecast/) are back in the saddle for another season, so go have a listen. The most recent episode features an interview with Richard B Wright about his new novel, _October_.
