And, via the aforementioned [cbcwatch](http://www.cbcwatch.ca/), a CBC lockout editorial from the Ottawa Sun called [When nobody looks](http://www.ottawasun.com/Comment/Editorial/2005/08/17/1176151.html).

Though it might be easy to shrug it off and say, &#8220;Those conservatives just don&#8217;t get Canadian public broadcasting,&#8221; much of the editorial rings troublingly true to my ears.
