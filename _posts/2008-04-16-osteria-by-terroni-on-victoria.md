Earlier this week, Jenna and I walked by the former Terroni at 106 Victoria, and saw a sign advertising the opening of &#8220;Osteria by Terroni.&#8221;

&#8220;Osteria&#8221; is the Italian word for tavern, and according to [this thread on Chowhound](http://www.chowhound.com/topics/470716#3285856), it may be a lunch place. When I lived on Victoria, we liked to go to Terroni for their Antipasto Misto, but curiously, since moving to Adelaide, the antipasto has disappeared.
