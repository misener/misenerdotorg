Now that a [deal](http://cbcunplugged.blogware.com/blog) has been reached, it&#8217;ll soon be time for me to actually find a job at the CBC. Here&#8217;s why:

My contract at CBC Windsor was up on September 4. The week before management locked us out, my managing editor offered me &#8220;a couple more months of work.&#8221; Not a job job, but work. Unfortunately, the offer was too late. It was midway through August, and I had no indication that I&#8217;d be asked to stay on. So I&#8217;d already made arrangements to move back to Toronto. 

Then, of course, we got locked out.

I picketed in Windsor for a week, then for a week in Toronto. Then I went back to Windsor for a weekend, during which I packed up and left. Jenna and I packed up all of my things in the back of a rented Corsica, and headed north. I settled back into [The Penthouse](http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/61f3e34c71e51c70eb94b6a4bb03f7f2/) with my roommates Tristan and Phil.

And the lockout continued on.

The lockout continued beyond the end of my contract. So I picketed beyond the end of my contract. I told myself I could do this with a clear conscience because if we hadn&#8217;t been locked out, I&#8217;d have continued on in Windsor.

I stayed up late. I slept in. I picketed. I worked on Toronto Unlocked. In many ways, it was a bit like a vacation. I got to visit picket lines in four Canadian cities. I met some fantastic people (including several of my radio heroes) on the line. I collected my cheques, and smiled.

Then, on September 6th, I received an email from Windsor, asking if I planned to return after the lockout to take my managing editor up on her offer.

I said no.

Why? I&#8217;d moved my things to Toronto. I was on the hook for rent in Toronto. I had nowhere to live in Windsor. I had started to fall for a girl in Toronto.

And now, a [deal](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051003.wcbc1003/BNStory/National/).

Once we go through the ratification process, and figure out how to get back to work, I&#8217;ll actually be looking for work. I have no job to go back to.

I&#8217;m hoping there might be CBL casual pool stuff for me. I&#8217;ll continue to pitch and sell freelance pieces. Hell, maybe if I get lucky, there&#8217;ll be a contract for me. Who knows?

The next little while will be fun, or scary, or exciting, or sad. Probably a little bit of all of the above. We&#8217;ll see.
