If you attend only one ukulele-related event in Corktown this week, make it this one. Steve and David of the [Corktown Ukulele Jam](http://torontoukes.com/) have arranged for the uke action to move to the front room of the Dominion on Queen, and the whole night will be captured on video and uploaded to YouTube.

> The Best of The Corktown Ukulele Jam, 8pm
  
> Wednesday, April 1, 2009
  
> Dominion on Queen, main room
  
> 500 Queen Street East (at Sumach, 2 west of the DVP), Toronto, ON

I&#8217;ll be there, reprising (at Steve&#8217;s request) my ukulele cover of &#8220;She&#8217;s Dead&#8221; by [Jim&#8217;s Big Ego](http://bigego.com/). Video to follow, if it&#8217;s any good.

See you there. Or not, as the case may be.
