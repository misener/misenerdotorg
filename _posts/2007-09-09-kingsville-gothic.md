A few months ago, Jenna and I visited Halifax. We spent a rainy afternoon with the enormously talented [Mat Dunlap](http://justfriends.ca/mat/), and he took a series of engagement photos for us. I&#8217;ve posted a few of them in [this Flickr set](http://flickr.com/photos/danmisener/sets/72157601884100734).

My favourite has to be this shot, which once manipulated by Photoshop wizard Mike Zikovitz, turned out beautifully:

Thanks Mat! Thanks Mike!
