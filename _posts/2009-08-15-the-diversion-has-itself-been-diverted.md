The [horrible streetcar screetching at Queen and Parliament](http://misener.org/archives/520) that I wrote about? For the past week, we&#8217;ve been spared. It seems that the previous diversion has been [diverted by more construction on the Queen East bridge](http://www3.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Route_diversions/501_Queen_DVP.jsp). So until August 27, the 501 will take this convoluted route:

> 501 Queen Streetcars will divert eastbound, from Yonge St.; east on Queen St., south on Victoria St., east on Adelaide St., south on Church St., east on King St., north on Parliament St., east on Dundas St., south on Broadview Ave., east on Queen St. to route. Streetcars will divert westbound, from Coxwell Ave.; west on Queen St., north on Broadview Ave., west on Dundas St., south on Parliament St., west on King St., north on Church St., west on Richmond St., north on Victoria St., west on Queen St. to route.

Laura and I tried to get to the subway today via the 501, and boy, was it confusing.
