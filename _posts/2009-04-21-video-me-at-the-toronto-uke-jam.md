So basically, every Wednesday for a bunch of weeks now, I&#8217;ve been going to the [Corktown Ukulele Jam](http://torontoukes.com/). It&#8217;s just down the street from my house at the Dominion on Queen, and it&#8217;s awesome.

A few weeks ago, the videotaped the whole night and put it on YouTube. Here&#8217;s me, doing a ukulele cover of &#8220;She&#8217;s Dead&#8221; by [Jim&#8217;s Big Ego](http://bigego.com/):



There&#8217;s a contest for these YouTube videos &#8212; the most viewed after a month wins a dinner at the Dominion, if I recall correctly. So feel free to watch this multiple times.
