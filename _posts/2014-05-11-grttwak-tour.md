CBC Radio has comissioned 10 episodes of [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/), based on the tiny little reading series I started back in 2007.

[That means a 10-city tour](http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/2014/05/tour-radio/).

It&#8217;s really difficult to explain how excited I am about this.
