I finally got around to reading them over the holidays, and recommend them both.

[Radio Skills](http://www.cbcshop.ca/CBC/shopping/product.aspx?Product_ID=CPGEN00016&Variant_ID=1748&lang=en-CA) goes through the process of getting a story to air, and covers interviewing, writing, vetting, and performance. The [Radio Style Guide](http://www.cbcshop.ca/CBC/shopping/product.aspx?Product_ID=CPGEN00017&Variant_ID=1804&lang=en-CA) goes deeper into writing and performance, with special focus on storytelling and writing for the ear. The section on focus sentences is an excellent summation of what McKee calls the &#8220;controlling idea.&#8221;

And now, you can get these books on the cheap with this [coupon code](http://www.redflagdeals.com/deals/main.php/coupons) for CBCShop.ca: &#8220;Save $10 off a purchase of $15+ with coupon code **kidscbc**.&#8221; But do it soon, because the offer ends January 31, 2005.
