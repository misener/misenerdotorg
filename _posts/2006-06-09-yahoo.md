I had lunch yesterday with my friend Christina, who shared with me the good news that she has a job&#8230; at Yahoo! She just graduated from Sheridan, she&#8217;s planning to move into Toronto soon, and it&#8217;s really nice to see things working out the way she wants them to. More details on [her blog](http://christinarcanales.com/blog/index.php/?p=8).

Congrats, Christina.
