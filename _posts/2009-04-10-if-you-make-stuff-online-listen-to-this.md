If you do creative work that lives online, you owe it to yourself to listen to [this episode](http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2009/03/merlin-mann-bros-chaps-jeff-olsen-of.html) of Jesse Thorn&#8217;s excellent [The Sound of Young America](http://www.maximumfun.org/). It&#8217;s a panel discussion with Jesse, Merlin Mann (of [43Folders.com](http://www.43folders.com/)), Mike and Matt Chapman (of [HomestarRunner.com](http://homestarrunner.com/)), and Jeff Olsen (of [Adult Swim](http://adultswim.com)).

Go ahead. Listen: [audio:http://media.libsyn.com/media/tsoya/tsoya090326_ima.mp3] 

It&#8217;s 55 minutes long, though. So maybe you&#8217;ll want to [download it from MaximumFun.org](http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2009/03/merlin-mann-bros-chaps-jeff-olsen-of.html). It&#8217;s a wide-ranging discussion, but ultimately, it&#8217;s about how to make stuff online that people will care about.

In particular, I found Jeff Olsen&#8217;s comments about unnecessarily consistent website design:

> I think a lot of what we do is the opposite of what people try and do in terms of branding, of &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be consistent, you know, we&#8217;re going to look the same way in all these different places.&#8221; I mean, you won&#8217;t see the Adult Swim logo hardly on our site at all. [&#8230;] I think branding and consistency, weirdly, can fight what it takes to provide great entertainment.

This reminds me a lot of what Mark Ramsey had to say about NPR website design:

> I don&#8217;t know why when I go visit a program website for NPR or wherever, I end up on npr.org/program, and the page looks just like every other program at NPR. What in the world is that? You mean to tell me that your program is virtually identical&#8230; that what&#8217;s important to me as a listener to this program is that it&#8217;s almost like every other one on NPR? That&#8217;s what you want to communicate to me?

Seriously. If you make stuff online, listen to this. It&#8217;s worth it.
