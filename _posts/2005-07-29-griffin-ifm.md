[<img src="http://griffintechnology.com/images/products/prod_ifm_diagram.jpg" border="0" alt="" />](http://griffintechnology.com/images/products/prod_ifm_diagram.jpg)Could it be? Could the newly announced [Griffin iFM](http://griffintechnology.com/products/ifm/) finally be the solution that enables high quality recording on the iPod? It&#8217;s plausable. The iFM is marketed as &#8220;a recording device, with a built in microphone to record voice, or change modes to capture live FM radio directly to the iPod!&#8221;

Surely consumers wouldn&#8217;t want to listen back to radio at the low bitrates that iPod imposes on recordings.

But&#8230; sadly that&#8217;s the case. The [iFM technical specs](http://griffintechnology.com/products/ifm/techspecs.php) page lists the recorded file quality as &#8220;8kHz, 16-bit mono WAV files (as specified by iPod).&#8221;

Still an interesting product idea. But I won&#8217;t be buying one.
