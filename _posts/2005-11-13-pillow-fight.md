I just got back from the [giant pillow fight](http://www.newmindspace.com/pillowfight.php) at Dundas Square.

Hilariously (and perhaps inappropriately) the organizers didn&#8217;t know there was a UTAG ([Uniting Toronto Against Guns](http://www.utag.ca/)) anti-gun rally going on at the same time. At some point though, the groups realized each other&#8217;s existence, and the UTAG emcee gave the pillow fighters big props.

The journalistic big boys were there (CFRB, CBC, CTV&#8230; presumably to cover the UTAG rally), plus lots of little guys (like me) documenting the pillow fight just for kicks.

Got some good interviews, including Kevin and Lori from newmindspace. We&#8217;ll see how it cuts together.
