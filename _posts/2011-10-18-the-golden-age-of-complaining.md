This week&#8217;s CBC tech column (I know, I know, I haven&#8217;t been vigilant in posting them here &#8212; that&#8217;s what the [podcast is for](http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/includes/misenerontech.xml)) is all about small business and social media.

According to David-Michel Davies, we live in a &#8220;golden age of complaining.&#8221; Davies, who is the executive director of Webby Awards, attributes this to social media. As part of CBC&#8217;s Small Business Week coverage, I wanted to find out what this golden age of complaining means for Canadian small businesses, so I called up Montreal-based digital marketer [Mitch Joel](http://www.twistimage.com/blog/).
