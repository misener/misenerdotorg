Kudos to Tod Maffin for organizing everything. I met some cool new people, and saw some familiar faces.

I&#8217;m not yet podcasting, but very interested, and plan to have something off the ground soon. I&#8217;d like to have something up by the time iTunes supports podcasts. I told a few people about my show idea last night, and most were responsive. There&#8217;s no motivation like the enthusiasm of others.
