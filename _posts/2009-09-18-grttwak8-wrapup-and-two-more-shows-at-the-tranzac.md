Laura Godfrey [wrote a nice piece about the latest](http://www.newsfix.ca/2009/09/17/diary-entries-and-‘pleasant-awkwardness’-rule-this-reading-series/) Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids show:

> On Wednesday night at The Tranzac downtown, a 34-year-old man took to the stage and spewed more than 60 insults and obscenities to a large crowd. They hooted with laughter, gasped at the more taboo terms and broke out into applause when it was all over.
> 
> Andrew Jehan’s performance was an extreme example of what audiences might hear at [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://www.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/), a free reading series whose name pretty much says it all. This was the eighth installment of a show where people read old diary entries, angsty teen poetry and mystifying grade school assignments to a roomful of strangers.

A big thanks to everyone who came out to GRTTWaK8 at the Tranzac on September 17th. It was a great time.

I have two more Wednesdays at the Tranzac this month, with two very excellent shows:

  * September 23: Singer/songwriters [Kevin Quain](http://www.myspace.com/kevinquain), [Patrick Walsh](http://www.myspace.com/dirtypatrickwalsh), and [Peirson Ross](http://www.myspace.com/peirsonross) ([Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=149998349602))
  * September 30: Japanese popsters [The Moist Towelettes](http://www.myspace.com/moisttowelettes) (Tokyo) wsg The Sweat ([Facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=136563170078))

Hope you can make it out.
