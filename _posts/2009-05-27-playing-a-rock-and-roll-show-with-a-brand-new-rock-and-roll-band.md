My pals Isaac and Joan of [Little Foot Long Foot](http://www.littlefootlongfoot.com/) are releasing their brand new CD [Harsh Words](http://www.littlefootlongfoot.com/merch.html) tomorrow night at the Rivoli. As opening acts, they&#8217;re getting a bunch of bands to cover the entire record, one band per song.

I&#8217;ll be performing as part of a brand new rock and roll band called **The Sweat**. We&#8217;ll do the LFLF song &#8220;King Hipster.&#8221;

That&#8217;s tomorrow night, 27 May 2009 at the [Rivoli](http://www.rivoli.ca/), starting at 9:00 PM. Cover is five bones. Or if you want a CD too, ten bones.
