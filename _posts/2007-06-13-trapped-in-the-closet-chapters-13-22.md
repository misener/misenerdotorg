My cousin Emily took us around town, and we ended up at [Newbury Comics](http://www.newburycomics.com/), where I found a relatively inexpensive copy of [Trapped in the Closet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_in_the_Closet), which I first saw [almost a year ago](http://misener.org/archives/197).

We watched it as soon as we got home, and then again this past weekend. As always, it struck me as a masterpiece, but left me wanting more. Its narative structure is, after all, patterned after soap opera.

So imagine my delight when shortly afterwards, while perusing Wikipedia&#8217;s entry for TITC, I stumbled upon this exciting news:

[<span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap"></span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources "Wikipedia:Citing sources")

> Chapters 13-22 are scheduled to be released July 24th, 2007 according to the inside booklet of [Double Up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Up "Double Up").

Waiting will be hard.

And just today, [Steve Pratt](http://stevepratt.typepad.com/) recommended a recent [review in Entertainment Weekly](http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20039780,00.html) of R. Kelly&#8217;s latest, Double Up. It does a great job of summing up Kell&#8217;s mystique as a performer:

> Kelly is kidding, right? If you&#8217;ve ever watched him lip-synch &#8221;Closet&#8221; in its entirety with a straight face, you know this is a riddle for the ages. Is a sex-as-food anthem like &#8221;Sweet Tooth&#8221; (&#8221;You&#8217;re lookin&#8217; like a big ole piece of cake&#8221;) deliberately campy? Your guess is as good as ours.

If you haven&#8217;t seen Trapped in the Closet, go buy it (or watch it on <strike>[YouTube](http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=026150F42E5D7A06)</strike> [Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2969374583886026984)). I&#8217;ll see you in the lineup July 24.
