Remember [that time I wasn&#8217;t allowed to bring my Brompton folding bicycle inside the CBC](http://misener.org/my-bike-is-not-a-health-and-safety-issue/)?

After raising a big fuss, I was eventually allowed to bring my bike inside, with the stipulation that it must be kept in a bag. I bought a Brompton cover from our neighbourhood Brompton dealer, [Switchback Cyclery](http://www.switchbackcyclery.ca/), and all has been well since.

Today, [Peter](http://ruk.ca) sent word that there&#8217;s a new BBC series called [W1A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W1A_(TV_series)) in which Hugh Bonneville plays the BBC&#8217;s Head of Values. I haven&#8217;t seen the series yet, but Peter notes that Bonneville&#8217;s character is allowed to bring _his_ Brompton into the BBC&#8217;s Broadcasting House _without_ a cover.
