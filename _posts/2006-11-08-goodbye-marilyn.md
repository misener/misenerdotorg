![Marilyn](http://static.flickr.com/120/292618487_845923549a.jpg "Marilyn")

Marilyn was my bass guitar.

I bought her from Musicstop on Cunard Street in Halifax. She&#8217;d been on hold for me for months, and I&#8217;d been slowly paying her down, bit by bit, while she waited patiently for me in the Musicstop warehouse. I made the final payment the day after I got back from visiting my friend Jamie Bambury in Kingston. It was the spring of 2001, and I&#8217;d just finished Foundation Year at King&#8217;s. Life felt really good that day.

I&#8217;d had a hankering for a new bass, and boy, did she fit just right.

Marilyn was a real, genuine, born-and-bred-in-the-U-S-A kind of bass guitar. She was sleek, and sexy, and she had five (count &#8217;em, five) strings that let me hit notes I didn&#8217;t even know existed. Plus, she was a really pretty shade of blue. I played her for five years straight, and she always sounded amazing to me. In that time, she came with me most everywhere I went, even to cities where I didn&#8217;t own an amp to play her through. Those times, I&#8217;d just pick her up and hold her. She felt good.

Marilyn was my bass guitar. But now I have a [new bass](http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0190209806), and as of today, Marilyn belongs to someone else.

Am I sad? A little. But we ended things on a good note.
