This morning before work, I stopped into the new coffee shop at 354 Queen Street East. Here&#8217;s what I learned:

  * It&#8217;s another [Savoury Grounds](http://www.torontolife.com/guide/restaurants/midday/savoury-grounds-coffee-co/) location, though they don&#8217;t have a sign yet
  * They have free WiFi
  * They&#8217;re open weekdays 7-6, and weekends 8-5
  * The owner&#8217;s name is Steven (or maybe Stephen)

The staff were really nice and the coffee was good. It&#8217;s a promising looking spot, and a nice addition to our corner.
