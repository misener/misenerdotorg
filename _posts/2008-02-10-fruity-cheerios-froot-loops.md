I&#8217;ve [posted before](http://misener.org/archives/295) about **Fruity Cheerios**, General Mills&#8217; answer to **Froot Loops**. Though I&#8217;ve not yet done a side-by-side comparison, I presume that the two products are fairly similar.

This morning, during brunch at **OK OK**, I spotted the two rival products sitting right next to each other. Note that they are the _only_ two cereals on display:

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new Coke/Pepsi.
