This morning, Facebook rolled out [Places](http://facebook.com/places/), their location-based service that lets users &#8220;check in&#8221; to places in the real world. Think Foursquare, Gowalla, et al, but on a much larger scale. Places is only available in the US right now, but still, that&#8217;s [131 million users](http://www.facebakers.com/countries-with-facebook/US/).

Here&#8217;s what I find particularly scary about this announcement: Facebook Place Tagging. From Jolie O&#8217;Dell at [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/08/19/facebook-places-guide/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Mashable+(Mashable)&utm_content=Google+Reader) (emphasis mine):

> You can add places, check in to places that already exist, and tag people who are with you. If you’re checking in for a group, make sure you tag your friends before you checkin, yourself. For example, I added my house and checked in there. **I then opened the Places page for a nearby sushi restaurant, tagged my boyfriend, and checked us both in there**.

Wait a minute! Other people can check _me_ in? Yup. According to [Facebook&#8217;s FAQ](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=17392):

> You can tag your friends who are with you at any given location as long as you are checked-in and they have set their privacy settings so they can be tagged.

The default settings &#8220;[for any check-ins are to have them visible only to your Facebook friends](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/08/facebook_adds_places_location-.html).&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s privacy settings let you opt out of Places sharing completely, but as [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/19/facebook-places-how-it-works) points out, if you don&#8217;t opt-out, &#8220;you will be asked to agree&#8221; the first time a friend tries to check you in.

It&#8217;s not hard to imagine how this could become incredibly problematic. Personally, I don&#8217;t want anyone but me to have the power to share my location. Remember [what happened to Plazes CEO Felix Peterson](http://bomega.com/2007/06/03/plazes-ceo-and-founder-exposed-by-own-tools/)? Or just consider any number of potentially [embarrassing Foursquare check-ins](http://www.flowtown.com/blog/the-worst-places-to-be-the-foursquare-mayor). Now, consider that all of your Facebook friends have the ability to create those awkward location-based snafus for you.

Two predictions:

  * It&#8217;s only be a matter of time before we see a blog dedicated to &#8220;embarrassing third-party Facebook Place check-ins&#8221;
  * The alibi fabrication industry is about to blow right up
