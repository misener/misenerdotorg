[Spy Lab](http://www.spylab.ca/) in Toronto has a sale on [Dunnits](http://www.dunnit.com). Since I recently discovered a hole in my left sneaker, I picked up new pair last night for $25.

How did I know they were on sale? Jenna told me.

How does Jenna manage to monitor sneaker prices along the entire length of Queen Street? I have no idea.
