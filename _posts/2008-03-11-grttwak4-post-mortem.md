The fourth installment of [Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids](http://read.danmisener.com/) was, like each of the previous events, a lot of fun.

This time around, we moved to a new venue: The Gladstone Hotel Ballroom. It turned out to be a great room for the event, with (almost) enough seating.

It&#8217;s my constant fear that I&#8217;ll put one of these events on, and a whole bunch of people will show up to listen, and no one will read. Luckily, that didn&#8217;t happen. We had 26 readers, a nice crowd of spectators (150+ said the bartender), and the whole thing was done in just under two hours. Jenna and I took a handful of photos, and some are in [this Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmisener/sets/72157604097578148/).

Also, for the first time, I asked readers&#8217; permission to put their readings on the web. Most said yes. So once I get all the audio sliced up, I plan to start releasing **Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids: The Podcast**. Stay tuned for that.

A big thanks to everyone who came out to read, everyone who came out to listen, and to the fine folks at the Gladstone who helped make it happen (especially Penny and Connie).

The next event will likely be in late May/early June.
