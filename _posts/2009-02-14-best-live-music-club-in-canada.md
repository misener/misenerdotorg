So CBC Radio 3 is doing a big, fancy, link-bait-y poll called [Best Live Music Club in Canada](http://radio3.cbc.ca/polls/?pollId=32). Ordinarily I wouldn&#8217;t post about something like this, but my pal Tom&#8217;s bar, [Phog](http://www.thephogblog.blogspot.com/), made the top 20, which is terrific. Phog is a great venue, both to play and to see a show.

I _could_ encourage you to vote for Phog. I could go on and on, extolling the virtues of this tiny, 60-capacity club in Windsor. I could tell you about the incredible amount of passion that [Tom](http://tomlucier.com/) puts into finding, booking, and bringing indie bands and arts events to Windsor. But I won&#8217;t. Instead, I offer these two simple exchanges that I hope illustrate why _I&#8217;ve_ been voting for Phog.

When I first moved to Windsor, I didn&#8217;t know anyone, and I walked into Phog one night. Tom was working the door.

> **Me:** &#8220;So what is there to do in this city?&#8221;
    
> **Tom:** &#8220;You&#8217;re standing in it.&#8221;

The second exchange was with co-owner Frank, shortly before I left the bar late one night:

> **Me (drunk):** &#8220;I think I have to go home now.&#8221;
    
> **Frank:** &#8220;You are home.&#8221;

Cheesy? Yes. Sentimental? Yes. But both sure made me feel that I was a really special place. You can vote daily for the [Best Live Music Club in Canada](http://radio3.cbc.ca/polls/?pollId=32), and I encourage you to. It&#8217;s going to mean a lot to the club that wins.
