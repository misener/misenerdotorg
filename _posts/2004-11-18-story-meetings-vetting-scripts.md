Earlier this week, I was invited to sit in on two regional program story meetings &#8212; one for Metro Morning, another for Here and Now. I&#8217;ve attended a few &#8220;real life&#8221; story meetings, and I always find it amazing and impressive that these meetings somehow turn into a radio show in a matter of hours. I took some good notes, and shooks some good hands. Plus was nice to meet [Andy Barrie](http://toronto.cbc.ca/metromorning/bios/barrie.jsp).

Also, things with my [Sean Ward](http://www.seanward.net) piece seem to be going well. In a strange turn of events, I submitted a script to Nick Davis on Sunday night, and when I arrived at the CBC security desk on Monday morning, they somehow thought I was there to see him. I wasn&#8217;t. I was there to see Joan Melanson, who had invited me in the first place. But Joan hadn&#8217;t yet arrived, so when &#8220;Matthew&#8221; came downstairs to get me, he told me that Nick knew I was there, and though he didn&#8217;t know why I was there, he wanted to see me.

So, after the story meetings, I vetted my script with him. I always enjoy working with people like Nick who have a really intimate knowledge of &#8220;story&#8221; and how it works in the context of radio. He had lots of really great suggestions, which I tried to incorporate into my next draft. We should start tracking narration soon, in time for the piece to air before the release of Sean&#8217;s next book on December 5th.

Also, while I was there, I chatted more with Joan about internships. She told me to stay in touch, and promised that &#8220;we&#8217;ll make it happen,&#8221; hopefully for a January 2005 start. I pitched her a variant on Atlantic Public Media&#8217;s [Sonic ID project](http://www.atlantic.org/projects/sonic_id.html), and let her know that I&#8217;ve got another proposal in the works for a series of short regular features. Sent her off an email this week outlining what I&#8217;m hoping to get out of an internship. Fingers still crossed.
