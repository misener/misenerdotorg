Via [Engadget](http://engadget.com/2006/01/13/micromemo-adds-16-bit-recording-to-ipod/) , news that XtremeMac has announced something called the MicroMemo, which

> consists of an adapter with a built-in (bur removable) flexible mic, and records 16-bit audio from 5G iPods at 22 KHz. It&#8217;s powered by the iPod and will cost $79.95 when it ships later this year.

One question: why 22KHz? Why not the take advantage of the iPod&#8217;s full capabilities? We already know it can do [16 bit/44.1 KHz/stereo](http://www.apple.com/ipod/specs.html).

Anyway, here&#8217;s a link to the [MicroMemo product page](http://www.xtrememac.com/audio/earphones_recorders/micromemo.php).
