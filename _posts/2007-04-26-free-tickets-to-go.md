For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been doing a series for [GO!](http://www.cbc.ca/go/) on CBC Radio One. In it, I solve problems in my personal life by hiring professionals. Two weeks ago, I realized that no one laughs at my jokes, so I hired a drummer to follow me around for a day and punctuate my humour with [stings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(percussion)) ([MP3 of the segment](http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-GoComedyDrummerApril142007887.mp3)).

Then, last week, I noticed that people always hang up on my voicemail. So I got some help from a couple of professional voiceover artists ([MP3 of the segment](http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-GoVoicemailApril212007196.mp3)).

This week, I plan to solve another problem, and you can hear it on your radio Saturday morning at 10, or online at [cbc.ca/listen](http://cbc.ca/listen)

Or better yet, if you&#8217;re in Toronto, there are still [tickets left for the show](http://www.cbc.ca/go/tickets.html). And they&#8217;re free. So if you like getting up early, come on down and be part of the studio audience. Because it&#8217;s fun.

**Update:** The show went well. Here&#8217;s an [MP3 of the segment](http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-GoLibrarianApril282007153.mp3).
