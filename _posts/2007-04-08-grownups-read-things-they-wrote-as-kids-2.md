I&#8217;m really excited and happy to let you know that we&#8217;re doing <span style="font-weight: bold">Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids</span> again.

8:00 PM on Monday, April 30, 2007
  
Upstairs at The Victory Cafe, 581 Markham Street, Toronto

That means you have about three weeks to clean out your closet, or dust off that shoebox of work from grade school, or call up your mom in Newfoundland and get her to send you that old letter from camp.

The first one was great, and this one should be just as fun, and free.

Hope to see you there.
