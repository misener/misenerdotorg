My favourite flavour of potato chip <strike>is</strike> was Salt and Vinegar Ruffles.

A few months ago, I started noticing that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find them on grocery store shelves. Then new flavours started to appear: **Thick Cut Au Gratin** and **Thick Cut Creamy Dill**.

A little [web-based research](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=salt+and+vinegar+ruffles&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), coupled with my own experience, leads me to believe that Salt and Vinegar Ruffles chips have been discontinued. The official [Ruffles website](http://www.fritolay.ca/fritolay/) makes no mention of them:

> RufflesÂ® potato chips are available in a variety of mouth-watering flavours to deliver the ultimate flavour experience. Available in BBQ, All Dressed, Sour Cream & Onion, Sour Cream & Bacon, Sour Cream & Cheddar, Lightly Salted, Thick Cut Au Gratin and Thick Cut Creamy Dill flavours!

Isn&#8217;t Salt and Vinegar a staple chip flavour? What&#8217;s going on here?

I&#8217;ll take Salt and Vinegar over Lightly Salted or Creamy Dill any day.
