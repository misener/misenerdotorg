I spent the Thanksgiving weekend in Nova Scotia.

Today I made a pledge to the [CKDU Funding Drive](http://fundingdrive.ckdu.ca/), which starts October 21st. CKDU is home to many of my favourite radio shows, like [Popped Culture](http://www.poppedculture.ca), [Let&#8217;s Get Baked](http://letsgetbaked.ckdu.ca), Smart Patrol, and The Rose Parade.

Why should you pledge? Aside from supporting community radio, there are great prizes. And this year&#8217;s t-shirts are hot!
