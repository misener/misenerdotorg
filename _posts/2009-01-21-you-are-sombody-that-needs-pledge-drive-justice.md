Via the latest [This American Life](http://thislife.org/) newsletter, some very, very funny pledge drive spots from Ira Glass. Click to listen:

  * [Megan.mp3](http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/pledge-calls/megan.mp3)
  * [Paul.mp3](http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/pledge-calls/paul.mp3)
  * [Kathleen.mp3](http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/pledge-calls/kathleen.mp3)

Though they&#8217;re funny, I don&#8217;t think these as effective as Ira&#8217;s twice-yearly, straight-up, arithmetic-based podcast promos.
