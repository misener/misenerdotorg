An [interesting article](http://poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=72449) from Poynter.org. John Sawatsky, whose &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; questions came up in conversation over the weekend, is discussed.

Apparently Sawatsky has been working for years on a book about interviewing. If it ever comes out, I&#8217;d love to read it. I know he did training seminars with the CBC. Maybe he&#8217;ll do lectures at their new [Canadian Institute for Training in Public Broadcasting](http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/training/)
