Need a reason to wake up super-early on a Saturday morning, trudge out into Toronto&#8217;s frigid February cold, and visit the CBC Broadcast Centre for a taping of [GO](http://www.cbc.ca/go/)?

I&#8217;ll give you three:

  * The kalimba stylings of [Laura Barrett](http://www.myspace.com/laurabarrett)
  * Something called a &#8220;Facebook Faceoff&#8221;
  * Me

I&#8217;m on GO this weekend and next. [Free tickets are still available for both shows](http://www.cbc.ca/go/tickets.html).
