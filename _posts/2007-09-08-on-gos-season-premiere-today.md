The sixth season of [Go](http://www.cbc.ca/go/) started this morning, and they were nice enough to have me back on the show. This time around, I talked about the many uses for a bicycle bell (outside of riding a bicycle).

You can download an [MP3 of the segment here](http://blip.tv/file/get/Dmisener-dm_go_bikebell484.mp3).
