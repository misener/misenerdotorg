I love podcasts.Â I listen to a lot of podcasts. And almost exclusively, I use my iPhone to listen to podcasts.

But heres&#8217;s the thing: subscribing to and downloading new podcasts to my iPhone is fiddly. Syncing with iTunes on my Mac is fiddly. Downloading new episodes a-la-carte via the iTunes app on iOS is fiddly.

Which is why I was absolutely delighted to learn about [Instacast](http://vemedio.com/products/instacast). It&#8217;s a standalone podcast downloader and player for iOS, and it&#8217;s exactly what the iPhone&#8217;s built-in _should have been_. I wish I&#8217;d known about it sooner. Here&#8217;s a video:

If you listen to or download podcasts regularly, and aren&#8217;t satisfied with iTunes, Instacast is well worth the $1.99 asking price.
