I&#8217;ve been waiting for this for years. A scant week after my iPod nano arrived in the mail, comes news that the new iPod (announced yesterday) [does proper stereo recording](http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2005/10/new-ipod-does-proper-stereo-recording.html).

Anyone want to buy an immaculate black 4 gig nano?

**Update:** iLounge has more details in their article [Why podcasters (and bootleggers?) will love the new iPod](http://ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/why-podcasters-and-bootleggers-will-love-the-new-ipod/).
