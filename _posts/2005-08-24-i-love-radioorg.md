From [Tod&#8217;s site](http://www.iloveradio.org) yesterday:

> Today, 6,253 &#8220;unique visitors&#8221; visited the blog &#8212; about a third were returning visitors. I have never seen traffic like this. I will certainly keep it up as long as I&#8217;m able to (the bandwidth costs are going to hurt).

I Love Radio.org has been a consistently wonderful resource for me and many others over the past year or so. It&#8217;s been especially nice recently to have such a comprehensive lockout-related site. This sentiment has been echoed over and over on the picket lines here in Toronto, and I&#8217;m sure, all across the world.

I know Tod has some small &#8220;Ads by Google&#8221; on his individual post pages (like [this one](http://radio.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/8/23/1164918.html)). I&#8217;m pretty sure he&#8217;s [not allowed](https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=16737&ctx=en:search&query=incentives&topic=0&type=f) to encourage others to click on them, but is there anything to stop me?

So, if you&#8217;re at his site (and I imagine if you&#8217;re reading this, you have been recently or will soon), and you see a Google ad that interests you &#8212; give &#8216;er a click.

Every little bit helps, right?
