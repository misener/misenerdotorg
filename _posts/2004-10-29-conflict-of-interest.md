Phoned Joe Mahoney and Stuart Einer at the CBC today to set up meetings. Voicemail on both counts. Why? Because I&#8217;m in class during the ideal times to call. For the past two days, I haven&#8217;t been able to get that last 1/2 hour of tape reviewed for the [Sean Ward](http://www.seanward.net) piece, because I&#8217;ve been working on my MIDI assignment and Ian McGettigan record analysis for Audio Theory class.

I haven&#8217;t been in touch with my producer at Metro Morning since he initially gave me the thumbs up, because I really don&#8217;t have anything to show him at this point, aside from a _lot_ of tape and several pages of notes on canary yellow paper (not unlike [this](http://www.transom.org/tools/beginnings/photos/whitestripes/200212.wplegal1.jpg)). I need to hurry up and finish my notes and write a script. Then I&#8217;ll have a reason to call again, other than to say, &#8220;Recording went well. Got some great stuff.&#8221; But to do all of this, I need time. Which schoolwork isn&#8217;t affording me right now. I&#8217;m worried this thing is dragging on, and I don&#8217;t want Mr. Producer to forget about me. To that end on the polka front, I emailed [Nick Purdon](http://www.cbc.ca/dnto/nick.html) to let him know I haven&#8217;t fallen off the edge of the earth.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I like my [classes](http://www.ryerson.ca/rta/). For the most part, they&#8217;re interesting and enjoyable, and I usually feel like I&#8217;m learning something. It&#8217;s cool that I get to program MIDI, and listen to records and research [podcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting) and call it all &#8220;homework.&#8221; I like school. But it just seems like lately it&#8217;s been getting in the way of the real world.
