Though it&#8217;s not strictly speaking a Hallow&#8217;een song, I still thought I&#8217;d share &#8220;[Zombie Apocalypse](http://craigandthecollaborators.bandcamp.com/track/zombie-apocalypse)&#8221; by Craig and the Collaborators, the occasional novelty band/recording project I&#8217;m involved with in Halifax.

## Zombie Apocalypse

What do I do now?
  
What do I do now?
  
Zombies came and ate all my friends. 

I&#8217;m so lonely
  
I&#8217;m so lonely
  
Will their hunger never end? 

Chris grew up just down the road from me
  
We went to school together since grade three
  
But I killed him with a shovel
  
Zombies ain&#8217;t your friends no more 

INSTRUMENTAL 

I&#8217;ll admit that parts of this apocalypse are good
  
I never have to brush my teeth even though I should
  
I don&#8217;t have to wait in line at the DMV
  
Instead I spend my waking hours running from zombies 

I had tickets to see Weezer
  
The zombies&#8217; timing couldn&#8217;t be worse 

Zombie Weezer wasn&#8217;t very good
  
Though they still played &#8220;Say It Ain&#8217;t So&#8221; 

If there&#8217;s one thing that you all should know
  
When you&#8217;re fighting zombies all alone 

What do we do now?
  
What do we do now?
  
Zombies came and ate all our friends 

Pack a suitcase
  
Find a broadsword
  
Broadswords don&#8217;t need bullets to work
