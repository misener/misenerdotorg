A little more than a year ago, I picked up an Mbox Mini in hopes of teaching myself Pro Tools at home. I played around with it a for a bit, but I always seemed to fall back on other multitrack editors. Because I didn&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> to get good at it, I didn&#8217;t get good at it.

Then I started using Pro Tools at [work](http://www.cbc.ca/spark), and once I knew what I was doing, my Mbox at home seemed much more appealing. Problem was, I&#8217;d upgraded my Mac to 10.5, and Pro Tools LE doesn&#8217;t play nice with 10.5.

After a long, frustrating period of silence following Leopard&#8217;s release, Digidesign has finally come out and [apologized for taking so long](http://duc.digidesign.com/showflat.php?Cat=&Number=1259137&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=186&fpart=1#Post1269787%231259137) to offer Leopard support. Dave Lebolt, general manager of Digidesign, predicts a compatible release will be available &#8220;within between 1 and 2 months&#8221; from April 5, 2008.

Fingers crossed.
