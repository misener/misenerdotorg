I&#8217;m really happy to report that SSID **Corktown_Free** extends a little farther east on Queen Street, thanks to Val, a neighbour I met this past weekend, and Savoury Grounds, the new coffee shop.

You can see an [updated coverage map here](http://public.meraki.com/network/Corktown), and more [details on the project here](https://sites.google.com/a/danmisener.com/corktown-wireless/Home).
